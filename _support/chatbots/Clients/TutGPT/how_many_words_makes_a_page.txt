Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no definite answer to that. There are many factors
that contribute to the number of words one page can contain. Some of the
more common ones are: font size, type of font used, line spacings, margins
of the document, etc. Intuitively speaking, the smaller the font size,
the more words you need; the smaller the line spacings, the more words
you need in a page.

As a general estimation, a typical page of single spaced document with
font size 12 pt takes approximately 500 words to fill the page.
