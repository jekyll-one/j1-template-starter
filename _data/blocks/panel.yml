                                          for anything beyond a one-page website. Some others see in

                                          The template system J1 is based on the <i>Ruby</i> language of version
                                          2.x. For sure, not the latest language version for <i>Ruby</i> but the
                                          supported platform for the latest <i>Jekyll</i> software.

                                          Websites created by Jekyll One are projects managed by NodeJS. The
                                          built-in script engine provided by the package manager npm of NodeJS
                                          simplifies the management of J1 projects a lot. Well-known commands
                                          typically used to manage software projects are at your fingertips.
                                          Easy to learn, easy to remember. Commands support creators to
                                          concentrate on the content.

                                          To not reinvent wheels, J1 Template is based on ready-to-use
                                          frameworks, extensions, and modules. All build-in
                                          frameworks are industry standard, well known, and accepted
                                          worldwide.

                                          For current webs, a must: responsiveness and modern design.
                                          Jekyll One is based on <i>Bootstrap</i>, the leading platform
                                          to create today's responsive webs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          Professional websites on the internet define standards. All
                                          current sites support dynamic, fast loading, and some more features.
                                          For fastest loading, all HTML, CSS, and Javascript have been compressed
                                          automatically for production. Going further for dynamic, AJAX loading
                                          for J1 webs is supported as well.
                                        </p>

                                          No way: icons and icon fonts are required to make a site understandable.
                                          J1 supports four icon fonts to manage this. Icons are used for extensions,
                                          modules, and content.
                                        </p>

                                          Software products of today are not easy to manage. To get the complexity
                                          out of your way, J1 is fully configurable. No need to dive in the deep.

                                          require programming and low-level customization. Deep knowledge

                                          Frameworks like Bootstrap and Asciidoc are enormously flexible and customizable.
                                          Changing or adding components to frameworks requires a lot of experience. That
                                          is not the idea of J1. Customizations for the base frameworks are prepared,
                                          simple to use, and usable out-of-the-box.

  #                                       Creating and managing Web sites using Jekyll is different
  #                                       in comparison to CMS Systems like Drupal, Joomla, or WordPress.
  #                                       No surprise: Jekyll One Template is <b>different</b> as well.
  #                                       Template systems are very common, a huge number of site
  #                                       templates are available for all CMS and Web site generators.
  #                                       The same to Jekyll. J1 Template is <b>not</b> the first
  #                                       template for Jekyll available - it is probably the <b>youngest</b>!
  #                                       <br \><br \>
  #                                       Classic templates are focussing the <b>layout</b> and <b>design</b>
  #                                       of a web. They offer pre-build, standardized <b>building blocks</b>
  #                                       and tools <b>designing</b> web sites. The are embedded into the
  #                                       creators system and often hard to customize. J1 for Jekyll goes different.
  #                                       J1 Template combines layout, design and <b>functionality</b> for a web.
  #                                       The template offers building blocks to create common page components,
  #                                       implements a system independent markup language (Asciidoc and Markdown)
  #                                       to create the content and adds a large number of useful functions based
  #                                       on common Javascript libraries for the web from a single source. That way,
  #                                       J1 web sites behaves as one unit in design <b>and</b> functionality.
  #                                       No breaks between the different components.
