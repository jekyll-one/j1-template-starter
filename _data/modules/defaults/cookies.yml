  #   checkCookies
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Check if cookies are created and available to the browser. If the
  #   cookie attributes does NOT allow to create and|or access on cookies,
  #   setting-up a page will fail.
  #   For testing sites deplayed on the Internet, it is recommended to enable
  #   checks on cookies to issue an error page (HTML 445) if access on cookies
  #   has failed for some reason. This will prevent severe failures and|or
  #   endless loops accessing a page on missing cookies or invalid cookie
  #   settings.
  #
  #   values:                           [false|true]
  #   default:                          false
  #
  #   encryptCookiesOnHttp (currently NOT supported)
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   If a website does not use encryption over the HTTPS protocol, the
  #   content written by J1 to cookies can be (AES) encrypted to prevent
  #   unwanted manipulation.
  #
  #   NOTE: For sites deployed on the Internet, it is highly recommended
  #         to use encryption (HTTPS protocol) for all sites to prevent
  #         (man-in-the-middle) attacks. If this is NOT possible, at least
  #         cookies should be encrypted to prevent attacks based on manipulated
  #         contents.
  #
  #   NOTE: Encrpytion on cookies is only enabled, if an unsecure connection
  #         over the HTTP protocol is detected. This is for performance reasons
  #         to not do time consuming calculations if a site is already
  #         encrypted.
  #
  #   values:                           [false|true]
  #   default:                          false
  #
  #   expireCookiesOnRequiredOnly
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   J1 uses permanent cookies to store user-related data and process stored
  #   data on subsequent visits. permanent cookies require consent, which is
  #   automatically displayed as a cookie banner on the first visit.
  #
  #   If the switch 'expireCookiesOnRequiredOnly' is set to 'true', all
  #   permanent cookies created by J1 are rewritten to session cookies if
  #   the consent for advanced cookies (type personalization or analysis) has
  #   been denied.
  #   The browser automatically deletes all session cookies when all browser
  #   sessions (windows/tabs) are closed. Since all session cookies are deleted
  #   automatically, this will result in a cookie consent dialog being
  #   displayed again on visitors next visit.
  #
  #   NOTE: It is recommended that permanent J1 cookies be rewritten to
  #         session cookies for visitors who reject advanced cookies. In
  #         addition, session cookies improve privacy policy compliance and
  #         increase the chance all cookies are accepted on return.
  #
  #   NOTE: Make sure that your website complies with applicable privacy
  #         regulations, such as the GDPR (DSGVO) or California California
  #         Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) by using the cookie banner provided
  #         by J1 Theme.
  #
  #   values:                           [false|true]
  #   default:                          true

  # Cookie settings
  #
  #   path
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Attribute 'path' indicates a URL PATH that must exist in the requested
  #   URL in order to send the Cookie header
  #
  #   values:                           string
  #   default:                          '/'
  #
  #   domain
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Switch 'domain' controls if the value for the attribute 'domain' is
  #   used (= auto|domain_string) or NOT used (false). If 'auto' is given,
  #   the domain is calculated from the hostname found in URL of the current
  #   page. Otherwise 'domain_string' is treates as domain to be used.
  #   If the switch 'domain' is set to 'false', the attribute 'domain' is
  #   not set, but automatically set by the browser to the (fully qualified)
  #   hostname and all subdomains are excluded from accessing the cookies.
  #
  #   NOTE: Be careful by setting switch 'domain' to auto. For sites deployed
  #         to hosts of public domain providers like Netlify (netlify.app),
  #         this will open the access on cookies to ALL hosts (subdomains)!
  #         See 'same_site'.
  #
  #   values:                           [false|auto|domain_string]
  #   default:                          false
  #
  #   expires
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   lifetime of a cookie [0..365] days. The value of 0 results in a
  #   SESSION cookie. For all otrher values >0, the cookie results in a
  #   PERMANENT cookie.
  #
  #   values:                           [0..365]
  #   default:                          0
  #
  #   same_site
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Lax:      Sent cookie for all requests, including subdomains, but
  #             not in cross-site requests.
  #   Strict:   The cookie is only sent to the site where it originated,
  #             excluding subdomains, but not in cross-site requests.
  #   None:     Send cookies in cross-site requests if the attribute
  #             'secure' is enabled. Note, the value 'None' can be only
  #             used for HTTPS requests.
  #
  #   values:                           [Strict|Lax|None]
  #   default:                          Strict
  #
  #   http_only
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Prevent access on cookies via JavaScript (client-side). Note, for
  #   client-side processing of cookies, like J1 Modules, never change
  #   the attribute to 'true'.
  #
  #   NOTE: The attribute 'http_only' is only used for web applications to
  #         store sensitive private user data (like passwords, account data) to
  #         to cookies. Only 'server-sided' web applications will be able to
  #         read cookies secured by 'http_only'.
  #
  #   values:                           [false|true]
  #   default:                          false
  #
  #   secure
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   If set to 'true', cookies are only sent to the server with an encrypted
  #   request over the HTTPS protocol. If set to 'auto', the attribute is
  #   ENABLED (set to 'true') automatically, if a secure connection (HTTPS)
  #   is detected.
  #
  #   NOTE: For sites deployed on the Internet, it is highly recommended
  #         to use encryption (HTTPS protocol) for all sites to prevent
  #         (man-in-the-middle) attacks (and manipulation on cookies).
  #
  #   values:                           [auto|false|true]
  #   default:                          auto
