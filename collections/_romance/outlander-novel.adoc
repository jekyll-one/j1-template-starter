In 18th-century Scotland, Claire encounters Jamie Fraser, a young Highland
warrior, and becomes entangled in a passionate and tumultuous love affair
with him. As she navigates the dangers and challenges of life in the past,
Claire must also reconcile her feelings for Jamie with her longing to return
to her own time.

Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire's destiny is
soon inextricably intertwined with Clan MacKenzie and the forbidden Castle
Leoch. She is catapulted without warning into the intrigues of lairds and
spies that may threaten her life ... and shatter her heart.

derring-do. Strong willed and sensual, Claire is an engaging modern heroine
plopped down in a simpler, more primitive time .. Great fun .. marvelous
and fantastic adventures, romance, sex .. perfect escape reading!""
