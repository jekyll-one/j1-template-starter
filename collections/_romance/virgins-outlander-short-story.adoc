                                        Year 1740. Young Jamie Fraser has left Scotland and, with his best friend Ian Murray,
                                        is running with a band of mercenaries in France.

                                        Both men have good reason not to go back to their homeland: both are nursing
                                        wounds, and despite their best efforts to remedy the situation, both are still
                                        virgins. So when a Jewish doctor hires them to escort his granddaughter to
                                        Paris, they readily agree. Both men are instantly drawn to the beautiful young
                                        lady.
