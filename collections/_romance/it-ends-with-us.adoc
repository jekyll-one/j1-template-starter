                                        Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working
                                        hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in
                                        Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and
                                        started her own business.

So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid,
everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is
assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive,
brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion
to relationships is disturbing.

As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of
Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He
was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears,
everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a
heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer.
It Ends With Us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate
price.
