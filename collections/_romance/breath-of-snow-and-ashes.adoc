As the Frasers settle in North Carolina, they face various challenges, both
personal and political. Claire continues her work as a healer, while Jamie
becomes involved in the growing revolutionary movement. The couple must
navigate dangerous circumstances, including encounters with hostile
Native American tribes, conflicts with the British army, and the looming
threat of war.

Meanwhile, their daughter Brianna and her husband Roger, who have also
traveled back in time from the 20th century, face their struggles. They
must adapt to life in the past, confront personal tragedies, and navigate
the complexities of their relationship and family dynamics.

The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of
rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and
in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest. With
chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry
and safeguard the colony for King and Crown.

But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round
the world will be fired, and the result will be independence with those
loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a
tiny clipping from _The Wilmington Gazette_, dated 1776, which reports Jamie's
death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may
be wrong about the future ...
