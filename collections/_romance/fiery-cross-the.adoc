Crossing the boundaries of genre with its unrivalled storytelling, Diana
Gabaldon's new novel is a gift both to her millions of loyal fans and to
the lucky readers who have yet to discover her.

The story of Outlander begins just after the Second World War, when a British
field nurse named Claire Randall walks through a cleft stone in the Scottish
highlands and is transported back some two hundred years to 1743. Here, now,
is The Fiery Cross, the eagerly awaited fifth volume in this remarkable,
award-winning series of historical novels. The year is 1771, and war is
approaching. Jamie Fraser s wife has told him so.

Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful
prophecy a time-traveller s certain knowledge. To break his oath to the
Crown will brand him a traitor; to keep it is certain doom. Jamie Fraser
stands in the shadow of the fiery cross a standard that leads nowhere but
to the bloody brink of war.
