Mid-century Dungatar is a small town, and small towns have long memories.
At first she wins over the suspicious locals with her extraordinary
dressmaking skills. But when the eccentric townsfolk turn on Tilly for a
second time, she decides to teach them a lesson and exact long-overdue
revenge.

Tilly's arrival sparks curiosity and gossip among the townspeople, who are
eager to discover the secrets she carries. She sets up a dressmaking business
and begins to create stunning and transformative garments for the women of
Dungatar, gradually gaining influence and challenging the conservative
conventions of the town.

As Tilly immerses herself in the community, she becomes entangled in a web
of relationships, including a romantic connection with Teddy McSwiney, a
local farmer. She also seeks to uncover the truth about her past, particularly
the circumstances surrounding a tragic incident during her childhood, which
led to her exile from Dungatar.

Packed with memorable characters, acid humour and luscious clothes,
The Dressmaker is an irresistible gothic tale of small-town revenge.
