In "When Breath Becomes Air," Kalanithi reflects on his life, career, and
the profound questions of meaning and mortality he grapples with after his
cancer diagnosis. The memoir explores his journey from being a promising
neurosurgeon to becoming a patient confronting his mortality. Kalanithi writes
about his passion for literature and philosophy and how they intersected with
his medical career. He delves into the intricacies of human existence, the
significance of relationships, and the impact of his diagnosis on his identity
nd sense of purpose.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient
struggling to live. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's
transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and
meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human
identity  &nbsp; -- &nbsp;  the brain  &nbsp; -- &nbsp;  and finally into a patient and a new father.

What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when
life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as
your own life fades away?

The book explores Kalanithi's experiences as a doctor and a patient,
providing a unique perspective on life, death, and the ethical dilemmas
medical professionals face. It is a poignant reflection on the fragility
of life and the search for meaning in the face of mortality.

Paul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet
his words live on as a guide to us all. When Breath Becomes Air is a
