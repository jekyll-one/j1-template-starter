In Forty Autumns, Nina Willner recounts the history of three generations of
her family - mothers, sisters, daughters and cousins - separated by forty years
of Soviet rule, and reunited after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Shortly after
the end of the Second World War, as the Soviets took control of the eastern
part of Germany, Hanna, a schoolteacher's daughter, escaped with nothing more
than a small suitcase and the clothes on her back.

As Hanna built a new life in the West, her relatives (her mother, father and
eight siblings) remained in the East. The construction of the Berlin Wall
severed all hope of any future reunion.

The book traces the story of the author's family, spanning four decades
and multiple generations. The central focus is on Willner's mother's side of
the family, who were separated by the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.
The author's mother, Hanna, escaped to West Germany, while her mother,
siblings, and other relatives remained in East Germany.

Hanna fell in love and moved to America. She made many attempts to establish
contact with her family, but most were unsuccessful. Her father was under
close observation; her mother, younger sister Heidi and the others struggled
to adjust to life under a bizarre and brutal regime that kept its citizens
cut off from the outside world.

A few years later, Hanna had a daughter — Nina — who grew up to become the
first female US Army intelligence officer to lead sensitive intelligence
collection operations in East Berlin at the height of the Cold War. At the
same time, Heidi's daughter, Cordula, was training to become a member of the
East German Olympic cycling team.

Though separated by only a few miles, Nina and her relatives led entirely
different lives. Once the Berlin Wall came down, and the families were
reunited, Nina Willner discovered an extraordinary story.

"Forty Autumns" highlights the resilience, determination, and courage of
individuals who lived through the division of Germany. It sheds light on
the sacrifices made by families separated by the Berlin Wall and the
enduring power of love and hope in the face of adversity.
