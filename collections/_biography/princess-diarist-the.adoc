The Princess Diarist is Carrie Fisher's intimate, hilarious and revealing
recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous
film sets of all time, the first Star Wars movie. When Carrie Fisher recently
discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first Star Wars
movie, she was astonished to see what they had preserved-plaintive love poems,
unbridled musings with youthful naivete, and a vulnerability that she barely
recognized.

Today, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon is indisputable,
but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a (sort-of) regular teenager.

In "The Princess Diarist," Carrie Fisher shares her experiences and reflections
on the making of the original "Star Wars" trilogy. The book primarily focuses
on her time filming the first "Star Wars" film, released in 1977, when she
was nineteen.

Fisher writes candidly about her insecurity, complex relationship with fame,
and experiences as a young actress thrust into the spotlight. She also reveals
a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with co-star Harrison Ford
during the filming of "Star Wars."

With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, The Princess Diarist is
Fisher's intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the
most famous film sets of all time-and what developed behind the scenes.
And today, as she reprises her most iconic role for the latest Star Wars
trilogy, Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the
absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by
her own outer-space royalty.

"The Princess Diarist" is a memoir and a reflection on the impact of
"Star Wars" on Fisher's life and career. It offers insights into the
challenges of fame, the pressures of being part of a beloved franchise,
and the lasting cultural significance of Princess Leia as a character.
