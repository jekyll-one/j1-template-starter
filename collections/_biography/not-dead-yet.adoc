Not Dead Yet is Phil Collins candid, witty, unvarnished story of the songs
and shows, the hits and pans, his marriages and divorces, the ascents to the
top of the charts and into the tabloid headlines. As one of only three
musicians to sell over 100 million records both in a group and as a solo
artist, Collins breathes rare air, but he has never lost his talent for
crafting songs that touch listeners around the globe.

This is the story of his epic career, from child actor to one of the most
successful songwriters of the pop music era.

Phil Collins shares his personal and professional journey, providing insights
into his life as a musician, his struggles with addiction and health issues,
and his experiences with fame and fortune. He recounts his childhood, his
early career with Genesis, his successful solo career, and his collaborations
with other notable artists.

The book delves into the highs and lows of Collins' life, including his
relationships, his passion for music, and the challenges he faced. It offers
readers a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes world of the music industry
and provides an intimate look at the man behind the music.

A drummer since almost before he could walk, Collins received on-the-job
training in the seedy, thrilling bars and clubs of 1960s swinging London
before finally landing the drum seat in Genesis. Later he would step into
the spotlight on vocals after the departure of Peter Gabriel, and compose
the songs that would rocket him to international solo fame with the release
of Face Value and *In the Air Tonight*.

Whether he's recalling jamming with Eric Clapton and Robert Plant, pulling
together a big band fronted by Tony Bennett, playing twice at Live Aid, or
writing the Oscar-winning music for Disney's smash-hit animated film Tarzan,
Collins keeps it intimate and his storytelling gift never wavers.
