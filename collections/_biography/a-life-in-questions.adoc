The no-nonsense star of BBC Newsnight, Paxman is a supreme inquisitor,
a master at skewering mammoth egos with his relentless grilling. Few figures
in public life have escaped. From John Major to Theresa May, from Tony Blair
to Ed Miliband, Paxman had them quaking in their boots.

His working life has been defined by questions. *Why is this bastard
lying to me?* was at the front of his mind as he conducted every interview.
But it wasn't just politicians. Paxman's interviews with Dizzee Rascal,
David Bowie, Russell Brand, Vivienne Westwood are legendary. He discussed
belief with religious leaders and philosophers, economics with CEOs and
bankers, books with writers and art and theatre with artists.

After 22 years on University Challenge, Paxman is also the longest-serving
active quizmaster on British television. Now, in these long-awaited memoirs,
he spills the beans behind four decades in front of the camera. He offers
reflections and stories from a career that has taken him as a reporter to
many of the world's war zones and trouble spots - Central America, Beirut,
Belfast, to the studios of Tonight, Panorama, Breakfast Time, the Six O'clock
News. Filled with candid stories about the great, the good and the rotters
that have crossed his path, his memoirs are as magnetic to read as Paxman
is to watch.

Candid, uncompromising, compassionate, reflective and astute, he writes
of the principles that have governed his professional life, the inner
workings of the BBC, the role of journalists in political debate, the
scandals and rows he's been part of, the books he has written and the
series he has made. In a book that tells some terrific stories and laughs
at much of the silliness in the world, A Life in Questions charts the life
of the greatest political interviewer of our time.
