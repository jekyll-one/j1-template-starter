J1 Template is a Bootstrap V5 website template for the static site generator
Jekyll.

The Theme J1 has been developed to create simple but fully configurable
websites. Jekyll One is a full-featured Theme for Jekyll to create modern
websites for free.

Many large today's companies like {url-docker--docs}[Docker, {browser-window--new}]
are using template-based systems to create their documentation sites. Or like
{url-oreilly-atlas--home}[O'Reilly Atlas, {browser-window--new}],
to provide a fully-featured writers platform for writing books or extensive
documentation.

All these platforms are technically different, but they share common ideas:

* the layout of all content (pages) is based on a standard skeleton but
  separated from the content
* content is written using a neutral meta-language
* the final output is not predefined
* the result is automatically generated by engines (robots)

To make these real, a lot of things are to be managed. You can imagine.
The approaches of Docker or O'Reilly points to a possible solution: a template
system based on _Bootstrap_ for the CCS framework, _Jekyll_ and _Liquid_ for
the core engines, and _Asciidoc_ (Asciidoctor) for a neutral meta-language
writing content.

The next thought comes to my mind. Why developing a toolset for only
document servers? Documentation webs of today are complex websites. Some
features used for general web design may be not needed for documentation
systems, but a lot of components are required that are wanted in general:

* a powerful CSS and Javascript framework
* a modular approach for dynamic content and apps
* a configuration system to separate content from the layout and to automate
  creation processes following the development pattern *MVC*
  (https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/[Model–View–Controller, {browser-window--new}])

A plan was made in 2016, based on Jekyll V3 and Bootstrap V3, to create a
template-based robot system that can be used for all types of websites, for
all standard formats to create digital content.

I was too optimistic about how long it would take to build such a system:

* easy to use by developers and non-technical people
* modular, powerful and stable
* supporting modern content design
* usable on common computer hardware, available to the public
* less in components, using well-known software
* entirely usable on small PCs locally as well as on powerful remote systems
  on the Internet

It took me ages. Now in early 2022, I can present the first version of
J1 Theme for the public. Hopefully, most of the objectives are achieved.
