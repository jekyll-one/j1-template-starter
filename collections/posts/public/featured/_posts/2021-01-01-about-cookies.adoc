Is it needed for visitors to know what cookies are about? No doubts, you're
requested to inform - in Europe for legal reasons. All users visiting websites
are bothered all the time to accept cookies. For good reasons.

== What are cookies technically

In short: a  cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your
browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the
website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. All modern
browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them
and can delete them whenever they like. Good to know.

Websites mainly use cookies for:

Identification::
Identify users

General information storage::
Remember users' custom preferences

Support::
Help users complete tasks without re-entering information when browsing from
one page to another or when visiting the site later.

Track behavioral::
Cookies can also be used for online behavioral target advertising and to
show adverts relevant to something that the user searched for in the past.
The webserver supplying the webpage can store a cookie on the user's
computer or mobile device.

All these cookies are called HTTP header cookies. Another way of storing
cookies is through JavaScript code contained or referenced on that page.
Each time the user requests a new page, the webserver can receive the
values of the cookies it previously set and return the page with content
relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code can read a
cookie belonging to its domain and act accordingly.

.How are they used
[NOTE]
====
The web server supplying the webpage can store a cookie on the user's
computer or mobile device. An external web server that manages files
included or referenced in the web page can store cookies. All these
cookies are called HTTP header cookies. Another way of storing cookies
is through JavaScript code contained or referenced on that page.

Each time the user requests a new page, the web server can receive the
values of the cookies it previously set and return the page with content
relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code can read a
cookie belonging to its domain and act accordingly.

== Types of cookies

HTTP cookies are essential to the modern Internet but potentially a
vulnerability to your privacy. As a necessary part of web browsing, cookies
help web developers give you more personal, convenient website visits.
Cookies let websites remember you, your website logins, shopping carts, and
more. But they can also be a treasure trove of private info for criminals
to spy on.

Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves aren't harmful.
They *can't infect* computers with viruses or other malware. However, some
cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions.
The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories.
Cookies generally can be classified by its *lifespan* and the *domain* to
which it belongs.

=== By Lifespan

Cookies classified by *lifespan* are either a:

Session cookie::
Session cookies gets automatically deleted when the user closes the web browser
and all open window tabs.

Persistent cookie::
A persistent cookie *remains* on the user's computer/device for a pre-defined
period of time.

=== By Domain

Cookies classified by the *domain* to which it belongs, are either of:

First-party cookie::
First-party cookie cookies are set by the webserver of the visited page
and share the *same domain* you're visiting. These are generally safer, as
long as users are browsing reputable websites or ones that have not been
compromised.

Third-party cookies::
Third-party cookies are stored by a *different* domain to the visited page.
This can happen when the webpage references a file located outside its domain.
Third-party cookies let advertisers or analytics companies track the user's
browsing history across the web on *any* sites that contain their ads.


== Security aspects on using cookies

Without cookies, the web would not work as it does today. However, since the
mid 90ies when cookies were invented, the web changed quite a lot, and so did
the attack methods on web applications; as mentioned, the Internet is not a
friendly place.

A well-known attack method is known as Cross-Site Request Forgery or short
*CSRF*. CSRF is an attack, a criminal act, that forces an end user to execute
unwanted actions. A cookie may play a *role* in such scenarios, but they are
not generally *unsafe* if you want, you can read more about that on the
CRSF Page on {url-owasp-attacks--csrf}[OWASP, {browser-window--new}].

== How to control cookies

Users can take control, used or *not* used, or delete cookies. For more
details, see {url-about-cookies--home}[AboutCookies]. You can delete
all cookies that are already on your computer, and you can set most
browsers to prevent them from being placed.

If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences
every time you visit a site, and some services and functionalities may not
work.
