The template system was initially developed to create a simple but fully
configurable website creation toolset for document servers. Document servers
provide websites or other content formats like PDF, projects, software
documentation, or similar approaches.

Many large today's companies like {url-docker--docs}[Docker, {browser-window--new}]
are using template-based systems to create their documentation sites. Or like
{url-oreilly-atlas--home}[O'Reilly Atlas, {browser-window--new}],
to provide a fully-featured writers platform for writing books or extensive
documentation.

All these platforms are technically different, but they share common ideas:

* the layout of all content (pages) is based on a standard skeleton but
  separated from the content
* content is written using a neutral meta-language
* the final output is not predefined
* the result is automatically generated by engines (robots)

To make these real, a lot of things are to be managed. You can imagine.
The approaches of Docker or O'Reilly points to a possible solution: a template
system based on _Bootstrap_ for the CCS framework, _Jekyll_ and _Liquid_ for
the core engines, and _Asciidoc_ (Asciidoctor) for a neutral meta-language
writing content.

The next thought comes to my mind. Why developing a toolset for only
document servers? Documentation webs of today are complex websites. Some
features used for general web design may be not needed for documentation
systems, but a lot of components are required that are wanted in general:

* a powerful CSS and Javascript framework
* a modular approach for dynamic content and apps
* a configuration system to separate content from the layout and to automate
  creation processes following the development pattern *MVC*
  (https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/[Model–View–Controller, {browser-window--new}])

A plan was made in 2016, based on Jekyll V3 and Bootstrap V3, to create a
template-based robot system that can be used for all types of websites, for
all standard formats to create digital content.

I was too optimistic about how long it would take to build such a system:

* easy to use by developers and non-technical people
* modular, powerful and stable
* supporting modern content design
* usable on common computer hardware, available to the public
* less in components, using well-known software
* entirely usable on small PCs locally as well as on powerful remote systems
  on the Internet

It took me nearly four years. Now, in early 2021, I can present the first
version of J1 Template for the public. Hopefully, most of the objectives
are achieved.

Have fun!
