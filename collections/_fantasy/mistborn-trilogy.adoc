An epic fantasy set in a world where the Dark Lord has gained dominion over
the world. A world of ash and pain. A world subjugated. But a world where
magic can be drawn from metals. A world waiting for a new heroine, a new hope.

A word of mouth bestseller in the USA Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy
have now become a massive hit in the UK, introducing readers to the work of
one of the genre's great talents. A master of world building, sweeping plots,
believable characters and engrossing magic systems.

The story is set in the world of Scadrial, a world covered in ash and ruled
by an immortal tyrant known as the Lord Ruler. The society is divided into
different social classes, with the nobility, known as the "skaa," oppressed
by the ruling class. The magic system in this world is based on the ability
to ingest and "burn" different types of metals, known as Allomancy.

The series's protagonist is Vin, a street urchin with a troubled past and a
talent for Allomancy. She becomes involved with a group of rebels planning
to overthrow the Lord Ruler and bring freedom to the skaa. Under the
guidance of Kelsier, a charismatic and skilled Allomancer, Vin trains
to become a powerful Mistborn and plays a pivotal role in the rebellion.

Throughout the trilogy, the characters face numerous challenges, including
political intrigue, betrayals, and epic battles against powerful forces.
The plot delves into the complex mythology and history of the world,
gradually revealing the secrets behind the magic system and the true nature
of Lord Ruler's rule.

The Mistborn Trilogy combines heist stories, epic fantasy, and intricate
world-building elements. It has been praised for its unique magic system,
compelling characters, and Sanderson's meticulous plotting and storytelling.
The series has gained a dedicated fan base and expanded into additional
books set in the same universe, known as the "Mistborn Era 2" series, as
well as standalone novels and novellas.
