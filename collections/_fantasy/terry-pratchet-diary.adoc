Terry Pratchett (1948-2015) was a highly acclaimed British author known for
his humorous and satirical fantasy novels. He was born on April 28, 1948,
in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England. Pratchett is best known for his
long-running Discworld series, which takes place in a flat world balanced
on the backs of four elephants, which in turn stand on the back of a giant
turtle swimming through space.

Pratchett published his first Discworld novel, "The Colour of Magic," in
1983 and went on to write more than 40 books set in the Discworld universe.
His witty and insightful writing style, combined with his unique blend of
fantasy, satire, and social commentary, earned him a dedicated following of
readers worldwide. Some of Pratchett's most beloved Discworld novels
include "Mort," "Guards! Guards!," "Reaper Man," "Small Gods," "Night Watch,"
and "Going Postal." He also wrote several standalone novels, including
"Good Omens" (co-written with Neil Gaiman) and "Nation."

In addition to his literary accomplishments, Terry Pratchett was a prominent
advocate for Alzheimer's research and awareness. He was diagnosed with
early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2007 and became a vocal supporter of
assisted dying for terminally ill individuals. Pratchett passed away on
March 12, 2015, but his legacy as one of our time's most beloved fantasy
authors continues to thrive.

Contributors include Neil Gaiman, A S Byatt, Terry Pratchett's literary agent
Colin Smythe, co-author of the Long Earth books Stephen Baxter, famed
bookseller Rog Peyton, and many more.

NOTE: With an introduction from his daughter Rhianna Pratchett and an afterword
from longtime friend and colleague Rob Wilkins.
