                                        Geralt is a witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training
                                        and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless
                                        assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious
                                        monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent.

In "Sword of Destiny, **Geralt**'s journey takes him to various locations and
introduces him to new characters. The book follows a non-linear narrative
structure, with each story providing insights into Geralt's past, present,
and future.

These stories and others in the collection provide further depth to Geralt's
character, relationships, and the morally ambiguous world he inhabits.
"Sword of Destiny" is known for exploring themes such as destiny, love,
and the consequences of one's actions.

It is worth noting that "The Witcher" series gained international popularity
and was adapted into a successful video game franchise and a Netflix
television series. "Sword of Destiny" is a crucial installment in the book
series, expanding the lore and capturing the essence of Geralt's adventures.

Geralt roams the country seeking assignments, but gradually comes to realise
that while some of his quarry are unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques,
others are the victims of sin, evil or simple naivety.

In this collection of short stories, following the adventures of the hit
collection THE LAST WISH, join Geralt as he battles monsters, demons and
prejudices alike ...
