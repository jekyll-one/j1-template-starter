For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing
only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century.
And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds
himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim
the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world
dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed.

Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending
his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you
can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love
on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed
by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate
reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised
that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person
who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation.
