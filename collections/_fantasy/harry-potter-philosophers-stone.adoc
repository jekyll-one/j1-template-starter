                                        When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old
                                        secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents
                                        were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and
                                        which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for
                                        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister
                                        mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor.

When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old
secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents
were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and
which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister
mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor.

Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be
valuable, dangerous - or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!
