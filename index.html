                                        Jekyll One Theme. JekyllOne is a Gem-based Theme made for the
                                        Static Site Generator (SSG) Jekyll. J1 Theme meets Jekyll and
                                        Bootstrap. And makes a lot of friends. The template system
                                        combines the best of free software for the web. Jekyll One
                                        Theme is OpenSource and the modules included are free to use
                                        as well.

                                        until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
                                        These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
                                        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
                                        though the transition does limit overflow.
