# Supported platforms

J1 is supported on all current **x64-based** OS:

* Windows 10, build >= 1903
* Windows WSL 2
* Linux, Kernel version >= 4.15 (e.g. Ubuntu  18.x LTS)
* OSX, version >= 10.10.5 (Yosemite)

Note that 32-bit versions (x32) are generally **not** supported for
**all** platforms.


# Development languages and tools

To run the Development System for J1 Theme, the following languages and
tools expected to be in place with your OS:

* Ruby language, version >= 2.7
* Python language, version > 2.7 (optional) <1>
* Javascript language (NodeJS), version >= 14.x < 15.x
* Git, version >= 2.29 (optional) <2>
* Jekyll, version 4.2.x

<1> Required only for **full** Jupyter Notebook support.
<2> Required only if J1 Projects should be managed as repos.

**NOTE**: More current or older versions may work, but not tested.

## Development packages

For some of the components J1 is using, a working C/C++ development
environment is needed to compile platform-specific libraries. Ensure
that all dev packages are installed for your OS (Linux, OSX, or Windows).

### Development packages for Windows

For Ruby on Windows, a installation using **RubyInstaller** is recommended.
A current Ruby of version **3.1** is available at the
[RubyInstaller V31](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-3.1.3-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-3.1.3-1-x64.exe)
site.
Note, to automatically install a development environment for Ruby on *Windows*,
a version of Ruby should be installed that is already **bundled** with a
**DEVKIT** (MSYS2 toolchain).

### Development packages on Linux (Ubuntu)

In order to install all required development components on e.g. Ubuntu
you run:

``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install \
gcc g++ make \
autoconf bison build-essential \
libssl-dev \
libyaml-dev \
libreadline-dev \
zlib1g-dev \
libncurses5-dev \
libffi-dev \
libgdbm-dev
```

To install the required languages and tools, if not already in place, the
following commands can be used to do so:

``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install \
curl \
git-all \
nodejs \
ruby
```

Additionally, for Ruby and NodeJS the dev-packages are to be installed to
make all header files available for a working C/C++ development environment:

``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install \
nodejs-dev \
ruby-dev
```

Note that priviliged (administrative) user rights are needed to install
system-wide software packages for Ruby and the OS.

### Development packages on OSX

For all OSX system, the installation of the Apple Developer Tools (XCode)
is expected. Development tools like Ruby, NodeJS, or the bash comes
with the OS are **not** recommended to use. Most of the software comes in
quite old versions and therefor unusable for J1 development.

To install recommended versions, the easiest way to install the missing
software is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). A lot of helpful information
how to manage package installations using Homebrew can be found on the
internet.

Beside the base installation of the recommend tools, all other recommendations
for Linux systems are for OSX the same.

## Upgrades needed for all platforms

If Ruby and NodeJS are in place, some packeages are to be upgraded to more
current versions. Install all packages system-wide with their respective
product installation pathes.

### Upgrades needed for Ruby <= v2.7

Install latest bundler for Ruby:

``` sh
gem install bundler --no-document
```

Install latest RubyGems for Ruby:

``` sh
gem install rubygems-update --no-document
update_rubygems --no-document
gem update --system
```

### Upgrades needed for NodeJS

NodeJS comes with NPM pre-installed. The native CLI for the NodeJS package
management is `npm`. Besides `npm` there's another quite handy CLI for NPM
available: *Yarn*.

The CLI `yarn` is developed at Facebook and can be used as a replacement
for `npm`. From a top-level perspective, both package management clients
behave pretty much the same. The syntax `yarn` uses is shorter in writing,
making the command-line look a bit more natural. Therefore, we prefer to
use `yarn`.

**NOTE**: Yarn adds some additional features to the NodeJS package
management implemented for the needs at Facebook. To use J1 Theme, those
add-ons are neither needed nor used.

Install latest *NPM* and *Yarn* packages for *NodeJS*:

``` sh
npm install -g npm@latest
npm install -g yarn@latest
```

# Managing J1 Projects

Managing J1 Theme projects is very simple:

* Install J1 Theme
* Setup a project
* Initialize the project
* Run the J1 Project

## Install J1 Theme

You can install J1 Theme in two ways:

* Installing the Ruby Gem of J1 Theme (recommended)
* Clone the current J1 Theme Repo from *Github*

The recommended method to install J1 is using the the **Ruby Gem**.
If you're using *Git* already, cloning the Repo at *Github* may an
option.

### Installing the Ruby Gem

It is highly recommended to install all project-related Ruby GEMs so-called
**userized**. The **user install** option of the *RubyGems* CLI **gem** will
install all requested Ruby Gems in the **home directory** of a user.
Installing userized prevents polluting the System Ruby Installation by
packages only needed by specific users or projects.

**IMPORTANT**: If you're on *Linux* (Unix), a system-wide installation of
Ruby GEMs requires **elevated** user rights (root). *Userized* installations
of Ruby packages can be done by all users **without** having elevated
user rights.

J1 Theme uses the **user install** option internally by **default**.
All depended Ruby GEMs are installed in the user's home directory in
folder `.gem`.

Prior to install the J1 Gem, make sure that a `.gem` folder already **exists**
in your **home** directory.

On *Windows*, run:

    mkdir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.gem

On *Unix/linux*, run:

    md $HOME/.gem

The latest version of J1 Theme is available at
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/j1-template/" target="_blank">RubyGems</a>
or can installed by the RubyGems CLI **gem**:

    gem install j1-template --no-document --user-install

**NOTE** The installation of the Gem will resolve all dependencies and
downloaad|install all dpended Ruby GEMs as required (userized).

### Checkout the Repo from Github

The Repo for the **latest** version of J1 Theme is published on Github.
You can get it by **cloning** the repository using **Git**`:

    git clone https://github.com/jekyll-one/j1-starter

The repo gets written to folder `j1-starter`. Have a look and
browse the folder. You'll see a structure like this:

General J1 Project Repo structure:

``` sh
  ├──── j1-starter
  │    └─── _data
  |    └─── _includes
  │    └─── _plugins
  │    └─── assets
  │    └─── collections
  │    └─── dot.bundle  
  │    └─── pages
  ├──── dot.gitattributes
  ├──── dot.gitignore
  ├──── dot.ruby-version
  ├──── dot.nojekyll
  ├──── dot.ruby-version
  ├──── favicon.ico
  ├──── Gemfile
  ├──── index.html          
  ├──── LICENSE.md
  ├──── package.json
  └──── README.md
```

**NOTE**: It is recommended to rename the folder `j1-template-starter` of
the cloned repo to a more specific (project) name.

All development **tasks** are defined as NPM **scripts** with the project
config file `package.json`. For your convenience, the J1 Theme Gem
comes with a build-in CLI **j1** run all project-related commands;
no need to learn **npm** or how to manage **NodeJS** projects.


## Setup the Project

The setup procedure depends on how you installed J1 Theme. If you are
using the J1 GEM as recommended, you need to **create** a personal project
first. If you have cloned the J1 Theme Repo from *Github*, the project
is already created by the clone's folder and you can skip the creation of
a project; continue on section **Initialize a J1 Project**.

### Create a J1 Project

First, you should make a folder holding all your J1 projects.
On *Windows*, run:

    mkdir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\j1-projects

Managing J1 Projects is simple: all tasks you need are run by the buildin
CLI **j1**. To create a new project inside the projects folder, run:

    cd %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\j1-projects && j1 generate my-starter

This command creates a **initial** project in folder **my-starter**.

```

## Initialize the project

To make a project usable, is has to be initialzed first. This is needed
only once after you create a **new** project.
On *Windows*, run the `setup` task like so:

    cd %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\j1-projects\my-starter && j1 setup

**NOTE**: While initializing a project, the J1 Theme Gem is downloaded as
a dependecy (if **not** already installed). For the users **cloned** the J1
Template repo (as a project), the J1 GEM will be installed and all **j1**
commands are available as well.

```

## Rebuild a project

For some reason, it may needed to re-create an existing project. The task
`rebuild` rebuild all documents (pages and posts) from the scratch but
leaves the base project files untouched.
To **reset** a project, run (inside the project folder):

    j1 reset

``` sh
Check consistency of the J1 project ...
Check setup state of the J1 project ...
REBUILD: Rebuild the projects website ...

## Reset a project

To start a project from the beginning, you can reset the system to the
factory state. The task `reset` does the resetting work for you
and cleans up each and everything except the **Git** repo and the modules
folder `node_modules` stored in the project root. Both are kept untouched
by a reset.

    j1 reset

The cleanup runs some tasks for the root folder and in parallel sub-tasks
using Lerna for all packages:

```
  Check consistency of the J1 project ...
  Check setup state of the J1 project ...
  2023-02-28 18:29:07 - RESET: Reset the project to factory state ...
