== Bootstrap Themes

Themes for Bootstrap are used to customize the appearance of a website
based on the basic rules and definitions of Bootstrapâ€™s CSS styles. The
use or change of a theme does not alter the functionality of the underlying
Bootstrap framework but modifies, for example, the color scheme, fonts, or
font sizes. Furthermore, the appearance of selected predefined HTML elements
like buttons, forms, or navigation elements may be adapted by a theme.

The underlying *Themer* Module uses the free themes for Bootstrap
provided by _Bootswatch_. The platform provides a large number of different
themes, using pre-compiled CSS files, to be directly used for websites using
Bootstrap V5.

The services at _Bootswatch_ use *permanent* Cookies to store relevant theme
information. Therefore, to use the themes feature of J1 Template, you must
agree on *permanent* Cookies for *personalization*.
