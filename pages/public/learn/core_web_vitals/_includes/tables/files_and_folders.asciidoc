|File\|Folder |Description

|`_config.yml`
|Stores all *side-wide* used configuration data. Many of these options can
be specified from the command line executable but it's easier to specify
them in a file so you don't have to remember them.

|`_drafts`
|Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a
date: `title.MARKUP`.

|`_includes`
|These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and
posts to facilitate reuse. The liquid tag `{% include file.ext %}` can be
used to include the partial in `_includes/file.ext`.

|`_layouts`
|This folder contains the templates that wrap posts and pages. Layouts
are chosen on a file-by-file basis in the YAML Front Matter, which is
described in the next section. The liquid tag `{{content}}` is used to
inject content into the web page.

|`_posts`
|The folder contains your blog post content. The naming convention of
these files is important, and must follow the format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.ext`.
The *permalinks* can be customized for each post, but the date and markup
language are determined solely by the file name.

|`_data`
|Well-formatted site data should be placed in that folder. The Jekyll
engine will autoload all YAML files in this directory (using either the
`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json` or `.csv` formats and extensions) and they will
be accessible via `site.data`. If there's a file e.g. `members.yml` under
the directory, then you can access contents of the file through
`site.data.members`.

|`_site`
|This folder is where the generated site will be placed (by default)
once Jekyll is done transforming it. It's probably a good idea to add
this to your `.gitignore` file if you're using _Git_ for version control.

|`.jekyll-metadata`
|This file helps Jekyll keep track of which files have not been modified
since the site was last built, and which files will need to be regenerated
on the next build. This file will not be included in the generated site.
It's probably a good idea to add this to your `.gitignore` file if you're
using _Git_ for version control.

|`index.html`
|`index.html` and other HTML, Asciidoc, Markdown, Textile files. If the
file contains a YAML *Front Matter* section, it will be transformed by
Jekyll. The same will happen for any `.html`, `.adoc`, `.markdown`, `.md`,
or `.textile` file in your site's root directory or directories not
listed above.

|Other Files or Folders
|Every other directory and file except for those listed above such as
`css` and `images` folders, `favicon.ico` files, and so forth will be
copied verbatim to the generated site. There are plenty of sites already
using Jekyll if you're curious to see how they're laid out.
