|Setting |Option |Flag |Description

|*Site Source*
|`source: DIR`
|`-s, --source DIR`
|Change the directory where Jekyll will read files

|*Site Destination*
|`destination: DIR` +
|`-d, --destination DIR`
|Change the directory where Jekyll will write files

|*Safe*
|`safe: BOOL`
|`--safe`
|Disable non-whitelisted plugins, caching to disk, and ignore symbolic links.

|*Exclude*
|`exclude: [DIR, FILE, ...]`
|`na`
|Exclude directories and/or files from the conversion. These exclusions
are relative to the site's source directory and cannot be outside the
source directory.

|*Include*
|`include: [DIR, FILE, ...]`
|`na`
|Force inclusion of directories and/or files in the conversion.
The file `.htaccess` is a good example since dotfiles are excluded
by default.

|*Keep files*
|`keep_files: [DIR, FILE, ...]`
|`na`
|When clobbering the site destination, keep the selected files. Useful
for files that are not generated by jekyll; e.g. files or assets that
are generated by your build tool. The paths are relative to the
`destination`.

|*Time Zone*
|`timezone: TIMEZONE`
|`na`
|Set the time zone for site generation. This sets the `TZ` environment
variable, which Ruby uses to handle time and date creation and
manipulation. Any entry from the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database[IANA Time Zone Database, {browser-window--new}]
is valid, e.g. `America/New_York`. A list of all available values can be
found from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones[here, {browser-window--new}].
The default is the local time zone, as set by your operating system.

|*Encoding*
|`encoding: ENCODING`
|`na`
|Set the encoding of files by name (only available for Ruby 1.9 or later).
The default value is `utf-8` starting in 2.0.0, and `nil` before 2.0.0,
which will yield the Ruby default of `ASCII-8BIT`.
