|Variable |Description

|`site.time`
|The current time (when you run the `jekyll` command).

|`site.pages`
|A list of all Pages.

|`site.posts`
|A reverse chronological list of all Posts.

|`site.related_posts`
|If the page being processed is a Post, this contains a list of up to ten
related Posts. By default, these are the ten most recent posts. For high
quality but slow to compute results, run the `jekyll` command with the `--lsi`
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis#Latent_semantic_indexing[latent semantic indexing])
option. Also note GitHub Pages does not support the `lsi` option when
generating sites.

|`site.static_files`
|A list of all (i.e. files not processed by Jekyll's converters or the Liquid
renderer). Each file has three properties: `path`, `modified_time` and
`extname`.

|`site.html_pages`
|A subset of `site.pages` listing those which end in `.html`.

|`site.html_files`
|A subset of `site.static_files` listing those which end in `.html`.

|`site.collections`
|A list of all the collections.

|`site.data`
|A list containing the data loaded from the YAML files located in the
`_data` directory.

|`site.documents`
|A list of all the documents in every collection.

|`site.categories.CATEGORY`
|The list of all Posts in category `CATEGORY`.

|`site.tags.TAG`
|The list of all Posts with tag `TAG`.

|`site.[CONFIGURATION_DATA]`
|All the variables set via the command line and your `_config.yml` are
available through the `site` variable. For example, if you have
`url: http://mysite.com` in your configuration file, then in your Posts and
Pages it will be stored in `site.url`. Jekyll does not parse changes to
`_config.yml` in `watch` mode, you must restart Jekyll to see changes to
variables.
