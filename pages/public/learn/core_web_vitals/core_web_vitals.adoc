== Core Web Vitals

In its recent attempt to make measuring and understanding a good user
experience easier, _Google_ has standardized the site's user experience
metrics. These standardized metrics, called *Core Web Vitals*, help
evaluate the *real-world* user experience of a website.

*Core Web Vitals* is a set of specific website performance metrics introduced
by Google to measure and quantify the user experience of a web page. They
focus on key aspects of web *page loading*, *interactivity*, and
*visual stability*, which are crucial for providing a good user experience.

The Core Web Vitals *metrics* are:

* First Contentful Paint (FCP): `FCP` measures how long it takes the browser
  to render the *first piece of DOM content* after a user navigates to your
  page. Images, non-white `<canvas>` elements, and SVGs on your page are
  considered DOM content; anything inside an iframe isn't included.
  Values should less than *1.8 seconds*.

* Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): LCP measures the loading speed of
  the main content on a web page. It represents the time taken for the
  largest visible element, such as an image or a block of text, to be
  rendered within the viewport. To provide a good user experience, the
  `LCP` should occur within the first *2.5 seconds* of the page starting
  to load.

* Total Blocking Time: `TBT` measures the total amount of time that a page
  is blocked from responding to user input, such as mouse clicks, screen
  taps, or keyboard presses. The sum is calculated by adding the blocking
  portion of all *long tasks* between *First Contentful Paint* (FCP) and
  *Time to Interactive*. Any task that executes for more than *50 ms* is a
  *long task*. Values for `TBT` should in total less than
  *200 milliseconds*.

* Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): `CLS` measures the *visual* stability
  of a web page. It quantifies how much the page layout *shifts* during
  the loading process. Layout shifts can be disruptive, causing users
  to accidentally click on the wrong elements or lose their place on
  the page. A good user experience aims for a `CLS` score of less than
  *0.1*.

Very good (excellent) website performance values for *Core Web Vitals*
takes a lot of work to achieve. Values like the screenshot below require
much work in the optimization and even then, can only rarely be achieved.

.Excellent performance values (Lighthouse)
lightbox::core_web_vitals_best_full[ 800, {data-image--core_web_vitals_best_full}, role="mt-3"]

Nevertheless, it makes sense to achieve the best possible performance. The
ranking of a website will improve a lot, and above all: the readers will
appreciate it and visit such sites again.

== Optimizise LCP

The Largest Contentful Paint or short *LCP* is one of the Core Web Vitals
metrics that measure when the largest *content element* becomes *visible* in
the browser. While other metrics like *TTFB* (time to first byte) and
First Contentful Paint (*FCP*) also help measure page experience, they don't
indicate when the page has become *meaningful* to the user.

Typically, the page provides only a less context information to the user
until the largest element becomes fully visible. LCP is, therefore, more
representative of user expectations. As a Core Web Vital metric, LCP accounts
for *25%* of the total performance ccore, making it one of the most important
metrics to optimize a page.

As per Google, the types of elements considered for Largest Contentful
Paint are:

* `<img>` elements
* `<image>` elements inside an `<svg>` element
* `<video>` elements (the poster image is used)
* An element with a background image loaded via the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url[url()]
  function (as opposed to a
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients[CSS])
  gradient
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements[Block-level]
  elements containing text nodes or other inline-level text elements.

Now, there are multiple ways to measure the LCP of your page. The easiest
ways to measure it online is available on
https://imagekit.io/blog/improve-google-pagespeed-insights-score-for-images/?utm_source=css-tricks&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=csstricks_LCP[PageSpeed Insights, {browser-window--new}].

Other Tools:

* Google Chrome Developer Tools (Lighthouse)
* Search Console (Core Web Vitals Report)

For example, *Google PageSpeed Insights* in
its report indicates the element considered for calculating the LCP.

// image::https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/LCP_Image.jpg?resize=1601%2C1201&ssl=1[image,width=558,height=419]

Now that you know what is LCP and what our target should be let’s look at
ways to improve LCP on our website. The underlying principle of reducing
LCP in all of the techniques mentioned below is to reduce the data downloaded
on the user’s device and reduce the time it takes to send and execute that
content.

=== Optimizing Images

On most websites, the above-the-fold content usually contains a large
image which gets considered for LCP. It could either be a hero image, a
banner, or a carousel. It is, therefore, crucial that you optimize these
images for a better LCP.

// image::https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/optimised-vs-unoptimised.jpeg?resize=1600%2C681&ssl=1[image,width=1600,height=681]

To optimize your images, you should use a third-party image CDN like
ImageKit.io. The advantage of using a third-party
https://imagekit.io/blog/what-is-image-cdn-guide/?utm_source=css-tricks&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=csstricks_LCP[image CDN, {browser-window--new}]
is that you can focus on your actual business and leave image
optimization to the image CDN.

The image CDN would stay at the edge of technology evolution, and you
always get the best possible features with minimum ongoing investment.

ImageKit is a complete real-time image CDN that integrates with any
existing cloud storage like AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud Storage, etc. It
even comes with its integrated image storage and manager called the
Media Library.

Here is how ImageKit can help you improve your LCP score.

==== Images in Lighter Formats

ImageKit detects if the user’s browser supports modern lighter formats
like WebP or AVIF and automatically delivers the image in the *lightest*
possible format in real-time. Formats like WebP are over 30% lighter
compared to their JPEG equivalents.

////

==== Automatically Compress Images

Not just converting the image to the correct format, ImageKit also
compresses your image to a smaller size. In doing so, it balances the
image’s visual quality and the output size.

You get the option to alter the compression level (or quality) in
real-time by just changing a URL parameter, thereby balancing your
business requirements of visual quality and load time.

// image::https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-compression-comparison_quality.jpeg?resize=1750%2C860&ssl=1[image,width=1750,height=860]

==== Real-time Transformations for Images

Google uses mobile-first indexing for almost all websites. It is
therefore essential to optimize LCP for mobile more than that for
desktop. Every image needs to be scaled down to as per the layout’s
requirement.

For example, you would need the image in a smaller size on the product
listing page and a larger size on the product detail page. This resizing
ensures that you are not sending any additional bytes than what is
required for that particular page.

ImageKit allows you to transform
https://imagekit.io/responsive-images/?utm_source=css-tricks&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=csstricks_LCP[responsive images, {browser-window--new}]
in real-time just by adding the corresponding transformation in
the image URL. For example, the following image is resized to width
200px and height 300px by adding the height and width transformation
parameters in its URL.

////

==== Caching Images

Image CDNs use a global
https://imagekit.io/blog/what-is-content-delivery-network-cdn-guide/?utm_source=css-tricks&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=csstricks_LCP[Content Delivery Network, {browser-window--new}]
(CDN) to deliver the images. Using a CDN ensures that images load from a
location closer to the user instead of your server, which could be halfway
across the globe.

// image::https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CDN_server_user.jpg?resize=702%2C250&ssl=1[image,width=702,height=250]

ImageKit, for example, uses AWS Cloudfront as its CDN, which has over
220 deliver nodes globally. A vast majority of the images get loaded in
less than 50ms. Additionally, it uses the proper caching directives to
cache the images on the user’s device, CDN nodes, and even its
processing network for a faster load time.

This helps to improve LCP on your website.


=== Client-side Optimization

==== Preload Critical Resources

There are certain cases where the browser may not prioritize loading a
visually important resource that impacts LCP. For example, a banner
image above the fold could be specified as a background image inside a
CSS file. Since the browser would never know about this image until the
CSS file is downloaded and parsed along with the DOM tree, it will not
prioritize loading it.

For such resources, you can preload them by adding a `<link>` tag with a
`rel= "preload"` attribute to the head section of your HTML document.

[source, html]
----
<!-- Example of preloading -->
<link rel="preload" src="banner_image.jpg">
----

While you can preload multiple resources in a document, you should
always restrict it to above-the-fold images or videos, page-wide font
files, or critical CSS and JS files.

==== Preconnect Third-party Origins

If you use third-party domains to deliver critical above-the-fold
content like JS, CSS, or images, then you would benefit by indicating to
the browser that a connection to that third-party domain needs to be
made as soon as possible. This is done using the `rel="preconnect"`
attribute of the `<link>` tag.

[source, html]
----
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://static.example.com">
----

With `preconnect` in place, the browser can save the domain connection
time when it downloads the actual resource later.

Subdomains like static.example.com, of your main website domain
example.com are also third-party domains in this context.

You can also use the _dns-prefetch_ as a fallback in browsers that don’t
support preconnect. This directive instructs the browser to complete the
DNS resolution to the third-party domain even if it cannot establish a
proper connection.

==== Compress Text Files

Any text-based data you load on your webpage should be compressed when
transferred over the network using a compression algorithm like gzip or
Brotli. SVGs, JSONs, API responses, JS and CSS files, and your main
page’s HTML are good candidates for compression using these algorithms.
This compression significantly reduces the amount of data that will get
downloaded on page load, therefore bringing down the LCP.

==== Remove Render-blocking Resources

When the browser receives the HTML page from your server, it parses the
DOM tree. If there is any external stylesheet or JS file in the DOM, the
browser has to pause for them before moving ahead with the parsing of
the remaining DOM tree.

These JS and CSS files are called render-blocking resources and delay
the LCP time. Here are some ways to reduce the blocking time for JS and
CSS files:

==== Remove Unnecessary Bundles

Avoid shipping huge bundles of JS and CSS files to the browser if they
are not needed. If the CSS can be downloaded a lot later, or a JS
functionality is not needed on a particular page, there is no reason to
load it up front and block the render in the browser.

Suppose you cannot split a particular file into smaller bundles, but it
is not critical to the functioning of the page either. In that case, you
can use the defer attribute of the script tag to indicate to the browser
that it can go ahead with the DOM parsing and continue to execute the JS
file at a later stage. Adding the defer attribute removes any blocker
for DOM parsing. The LCP, therefore, goes down.

==== Use Inline CSS

Critical CSS comprises the style definitions needed for the DOM that
appears in the first fold of your page. If the style definitions for
this part of the page are inline, i.e., in each element’s `style`
attribute, the browser has no dependency on the external CSS to style
these elements. Therefore, it can render the page quickly, and the LCP
goes down.

==== Minify Content

You should always minify the CSS and JS files before loading them in the
browser. CSS and JS files contain whitespace to make them legible, but
they are unnecessary for code execution. So, you can remove them, which
reduces the file size on production. Smaller file size means that the
files can load quickly, thereby reducing your LCP time.

Compression techniques, as discussed earlier, use data compression
algorithms to bring down the file size delivered over the network. Gzip
and Brotli are two compression algorithms.
https://imagekit.io/blog/what-and-why-brotli-compression/?utm_source=css-tricks&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=csstricks_LCP[Brotli compression, {browser-window--new}]
offers a superior compression ratio compared to Gzip and is
now supported on all major browsers, servers, and CDNs.


=== Server-side Optimization

A lot of computation, DB queries, and page construction happens on the
server. You should analyze the requests going to your servers and
identify the possible bottlenecks for responding to the requests. It
could be a DB query slowing things down or the building of the page on
your server.

You can apply best practices like caching of DB responses, pre-rendering
of pages, amongst others, to reduce the time it takes for your server to
respond to requests.

Of course, if the above does not improve the response time, you might
need to increase your server capacity to handle the number of requests
coming in.

==== Reduce Response Times

If your server takes long to respond to a request, then the time it
takes to render the page on the screen also goes up. It, therefore,
negatively affects every page speed metric, including LCP. To improve
your server response times, here is what you should do.

==== Content Delivery Network (CDN)

We have already seen above that using an image CDN like ImageKit
improves the loading time for your images. Your users get the content
delivered from a CDN node close to their location in milliseconds.

// image::https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/with-cdn.jpg?resize=452%2C250&ssl=1[image,width=452,height=250]

You should extend the same to other content on your website. Using a CDN
for your static content like JS, CSS, and font files will significantly
speed up their load time. ImageKit does support the delivery of static
content through its systems.

You can also try to use a CDN for your HTML and APIs to cache those
responses on the CDN nodes. Given the dynamic nature of such content,
using a CDN for HTML or APIs can be a lot more complex than using a CDN
for static content.

////
=== Conclusion

Core Web Vitals, which include LCP, have become a significant search
ranking factor and strongly correlate with the user experience.
Therefore, if you run an online business, you should optimize these
vitals to ensure the success of the same.

The above techniques have a significant impact on optimizing LCP. Using
ImageKit as your image CDN will give you a quick headstart.
