The J1 Template system support playing video on web pages by HTML5 video,
the new standard of HTML to show videos on webpages natively.

Modern browsers support the video tag `<video>` for the current HTML V5
standard. The previous proprietary software like _Flash Player_, _Quicktime_,
or _Silverlight_ is no longer needed as J1 provides HTML Video and VideoJS
support for local video and from online sources on the Internet.

== HTML5 Video

HTML5 video opens the doors to your way of presenting video content on your
web. All modern browsers support the video tag `<video>`. Browsers have a
built-in multimedia framework already for decoding and displaying video
content. No need to use proprietary software components anymore.

Two types of video sources are supported:

* Video files from local folders (your webspace)
* Video files from online sources (on the Internet) like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

[role="mb-4"]
The combination of a gallery and a lightbox is entirely usable for all
the video content you want to present on your site. You can place galleries
elsewhere with your content. You can use them for blogs by putting them into
your article's content.

[CAUTION]
====
The module lightGallery can be used for free for private use, but a
*commercial license* is required for business or commercial websites. See
link:{url-light-gallery--license}[LightGallery Licenses, {browser-window--new}]
how to use lightGallery for *commercial* websites and projects.

[role="mt-5"]
== Standalone Players

Video players embedded in Web pages are software components that integrate
and play videos directly within a web page or application. These players
are essential for websites, blogs, and apps that want to display video content
without requiring users to download the video file or use any external
media player.

Embedded video players provide a seamless and user-friendly way to present
video content to your audience.

[role="mt-4"]
=== HTML5 Player

Modern browsers support the video tag `<video>` for the current version of
HTML. The browsers support a framework for decoding and displaying video
content.

== Galleries of Video

Video galleries are collections to display videos organized around a specific
theme, topic, or purpose. The gallery module (lightGallery) for J1 Template is
a fast, modular, and responsive plugin to create beautiful-looking, featured
image and video galleries.

and video content provided online via YouTube.

Videos created by a digicam or a mobile can be played by J1 Template using
the lightGallery integration. Present videos you have made at it's best.

[NOTE]
====
The current file size of Local Video is *limited* to *50MB* (Git LFS limit).
Using a modern MP4 Encoder (H264|H265 compression), a video will have a
playing time of around ~*3-5 minutes* for HD 1080p (1920x1080) or
up to ~*10 minutes* for HD 720p (1280x720) resolution.

== What next

Images and videos are pretty visual. And it can be impressive, for sure.
But the most visual component on all web pages is text, for all sites on
the Internet.

Sadly, one common flaw in many templates and frameworks is a lack of support
for *responsive text*. While other elements on a page resize fluidly, the
text still resizes fixed. To avoid this issue, especially for heavily
text-focused pages, J1 Template supports a fluidly scaled text that changes
in size and line height to optimize readability for the user.

The JekyllOne Template places the character font as one of the most crucial
*branding element* for any website. Typography matters for any media presenting
text. The text will take on an important role of acting as plain text and as
something like images. To see how text could be presented great for modern
responsive webs.
