== Responsive Text

Sadly, one common flaw is seen in many templates and frameworks: a lack of
support for genuinely responsive text. While elements on a page resize
fluidly, the text still resizes on a fixed basis. To avoid this issue,
especially for heavily text-focused pages, J1 Theme supports styles that
fluidly scale text size and line height to optimize readability for the user.

Below you find an example of how text behaves if defined on a fixed basis -
what you'll see quite often. Change the size of your Browser Window to see
what will happen in terms of responsiveness.

  <button type="button" name="toggle-r-text" class="btn btn-primary btn-flex mt-3 mb-3">
    <i class="toggle-button mdi mdi-toggle-switch-off mdi-lg mdi-md-bg-primary-50 mr-1"></i>
    Toggle rtext
  </button>
  <div class="mb-4">
    <div class="content">
      <!-- jadams, 2020-11-15: adjusted heading levels (Google optimisation) -->
      <h3 class="notoc">The Extremes of Good and Evil</h3>
      <p class="small notoc text-gray mb-3">Cicero, Paragraph 1.10.32 · Translation by H. Rackham, Issue 1914 - De Finibus</p>
      <p class="toggle-description no-r-text">
        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
        <br/><br/>
        No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor
        again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
        of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
        occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        <br/><br/>
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
        physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
        has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
        that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
        produces no resultant pleasure?

  });

== Scaling Responsive Text

The responsive text comes in five different scale factors in a range from 100
to 500. Scaling `r-text` gives you the flexibility to use `r-text` everywhere.
Or you can offer different text sizes of your Web for visitors having visual
handicaps or reading disabilities.

To see `r-text` scaling in action, click on the button above to resize
the text from `r-text` level 300 to 500 back and forth. Resize
your Browser and watch the size of this text body change to see the
responsiveness in action.

    <i class="scale-button mdi mdi-arrow-up mdi-lg mdi-md-bg-primary-50 mr-1"></i>

      <p class="small notoc text-gray mb-3">Cicero, Paragraph 1.10.32 · Translation by H. Rackham, Issue 1914 - De Finibus</p>
      <p class="scale-description r-text-300">
        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
        are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
        bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
        weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
        <br/><br/>
        These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when
        our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to
        do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
        But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
        of business is will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
        annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to
        this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
        pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

  });

== Scale factors

As mentioned, `r-text` comes in five levels of size. The base of `r-text` is
the Fibonacci numbers extracted from the Fibonacci series. These numbers are
the most popular division ratios in typography. When speaking of the golden
ratio (1: 1.618) in typography and graphic design, the Fibonacci numbers are
usually the base.

The Fibonacci series is translated into CSS Media queries and scales a base
font in size accordingly. Further, the resulting font scale series have
multipliers (scale factors) ranging from 0.5 (50%) up to 1.0 (100%) of the
base.

That way, five series are available by the five scale factors. See the
following table how `r-text` scales.
