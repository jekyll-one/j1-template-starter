The Jekyll Theme J1 places the character font as one of the most crucial
branding elements for any website. Typography matters for any page
presenting text. The text will take on an important role of acting not
only as plain text but also as something like images.

== Responsive Text

Sadly to say, one common flaw is seen in many templates and frameworks:
the lack of support for responsive text. While elements on a page resize
fluidly, the text still resizes on a fixed basis. To avoid this issue,
especially for heavily text-focused pages, J1 Template supports styles that
fluidly scale text in size and line height to optimize readability for the
user.

Below you find an example of how text behaves if defined on a fixed basis -
what you'll see quite often. Change the size of your Browser Window to see
what will happen in terms of responsiveness.

    Toggle rtext
  </button>
  <div class="speak2me-ignore mb-4">

        No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor
        again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
        of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
        occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        <br/><br/>
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
        physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
        has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
        that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
        produces no resultant pleasure?

== Text Scaling

Responsive text comes in five different scale factors in a range from 100
to 500. Scaling `r-text` gives you the flexibility to use responsive text
`r-text` everywhere. Or you can offer different text sizes of your Web for
visitors having visual handicaps or reading disabilities *without* bothering
your visitors for changing their browser settings.

To see the text `r-text` scaling in action, click on the button above to
resize the text from `r-text` level 300 to 500 back and forth. Resize your
Browser and watch the size of this text body change to see the responsiveness
in action.

      <p class="small notoc text-gray mb-3">Cicero, Paragraph 1.10.32 · Translation by H. Rackham, Issue 1914 - De Finibus</p>
      <p class="scale-description r-text-300">
        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
        are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
        bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
        weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
        <br/><br/>
        These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when
        our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to
        do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
        But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
        of business is will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
        annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to
        this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
        pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

== Scale factors

As mentioned, responsive text `r-text` comes in five levels of size. The
base of responsive text `r-text` is the Fibonacci numbers extracted from
the Fibonacci series.

These numbers are the most popular division ratios in typography. Fibonacci
numbers are relevant in design and typography due to their prevalence in
natural patterns.

The Fibonacci series is translated into CSS Media queries and scales a base
font in size accordingly. Further, the resulting font scale series have
multipliers ranging from 100 up to 500, resulting in 100% of the base.

That way, five series are available by the five scale factors. See the
following table how responsive text `r-text` scales.
