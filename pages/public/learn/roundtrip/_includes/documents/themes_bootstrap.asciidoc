== The Themes Menu

Styles adjust the website's appearance based on the CSS rules and definitions
of Bootstrap. Styles do not change the framework's functionality but modify
rule-based, e.g., the color scheme, fonts, sizes, or the appearance of more
complex elements like forms or tables. Additionally, a style may add additional
components to extend the Bootstrap's framework.

Modifying the CSS styles of link:{url-bs--home}[Bootstrap, {browser-window--new}]
is not rocket science. But, to be honest, some knowledge is needed for the
link:{url-w3org--css-spec}[CSS technology, {browser-window--new}] to do so.
I encourage you to spend some time on learning CSS, the
link:{url-w3schools--css-tutorial}[Design base, {browser-window--new}] of each
and every website.

Thanks to the people at link:{url-bootswatch--home}[Bootswatch, {browser-window--new}],
a great set of already prepared Bootstrap stylesheets in various designs are
available on their website; no need to start from scratch. It is not
required to re-define all the Bootstrap variables and rebuild the framework.
Many different styles are available. What is already available at Bootswatch
is at least a good base for your modifications -- your unique design.

Besides the bunch of different stylesheets at *Bootswatch*, an
link:{url-bootswatch--api}[Integration API, {browser-window--new}] is provided
that helps a lot to make designs available for an existing site. This API
is the base to integrate selectable Bootswatch stylesheets into the J1 Template
navigation system.

=== Apply a Style

The base for designing pages using the J1 Template is the style Uno, a modern
light or dark CSS layout used for many types of websites. What I mentioned
already, web design is not: one size fits all. The style Uno can be seen as
a good base, a starting point. Combining Uno and a different styles may be
a fast solution for your site!

You can find all available stylesheets to be applied on your pages from the
*Themes* menu. You're invited to check how a page is changing for its design
if a different stylesheet for web design is used.

[WARNING]
====
For changing from one style to the next at *runtime*, the current
version of the J1 Template system tries add new styles to J1 specific
components like fonts, headlines, lists or paragraphs. Changing the style
will work for the most *common* elements, but *not all* of them for now.
====

Select a style from the *Themes* menu, and the new BS-based stylesheet is
automatically applied to all pages of your website.
