== Github Gist

Code snippets may helpful to support your readers for existing code examples.
An excellent place for code snippets is Gist at Github. To embed an existing
gist into your documents, the Asciidoc Extention *Gist block* provides the gist
block macro `gist::` to do so.

The following gist snippet is taken from link:{url-asciidoc-extensions--gist-example}[this example, window="_blank"]:
