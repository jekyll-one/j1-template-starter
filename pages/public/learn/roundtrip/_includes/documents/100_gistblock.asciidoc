== Github Gist

Code snippets may helpful to support your readers for existing code examples.
An excellent place for code snippets is  at Github. To embed an existing
gist into your documents, the Asciidoc Extention *Gist block* provides the
block macro `gist::` to do so.

The following *Gist* snippet is taken from this
