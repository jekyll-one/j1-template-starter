The search option for the J1 Theme is based on the search engine Lunr and
is fully integrated with the Template. Lunr is designed to be lightweight yet
full-featured to provide users with a great search experience. Using Lunr for
a Jekyll website, there is no need to integrate complex external, server-sided
search engines like Google or Bing.

Searching a website using QuickSearch is different from search engines like
Google or Microsoft Bing. Those search platforms using complex algorithms to
provide a simple interface to the public but using a lot of artificial
intelligence (AI) methods to make sense of results out of a handful of words
given for a search.

Nevertheless, QuickSearch, the J1 implementation of Lunr, is simple like
searching at Google but offers additional features to do searches more
specifically - if wanted. QuickSearch provides an easy-to-use query language
for better results - with no advertising if wanted!

// Include sub-documents (if any)

== Core concepts

Understanding some of the concepts and terminology that QuickSearch (Lunr)
uses will allow users to provide powerful search functionality - to get more
relevant search results.

=== Indexing documents

QuickSearch offers searches on *all* documents of the website generated by J1
but only for this site. Advantage, no internet access is done for searches
because it's not needed. Searches are based on a pre-build local site
*full-text* index loaded by the browser on a page request. The index for a
site is generated by the (Jekyll) plugin `lunr_index.rb` located in the
`_plugins` folder.

The full-text index is always generated by Jekyll at build-time:

.Index creation at buildtime
----
Startup the site ..
Configuration file: ...

 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
     J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
     J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
     ....
----

Or, if you're running a website in development mode, the index get refreshed
for all files added or modified.

.Index creation if files added, or modified
----
site:       Regenerating: n file(s) changed at ...
site:       ...
site:      J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
site:      J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
           ...
----

=== Documents

The searchable data in an index is organized as documents containing the
text and the words (terms) you want to search on. A document is a data set
(JSON object) with fields that are processed to create the result list for
a search.

A document data set might look like this:

[source, json, role="noclip"]
----
{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "Roundtrip",
  "tagline": "present images",
  "url": "/pages/public/learn/roundtrip/present_images/",
  "date": "2020-11-03 00:00:00 +0100",
  "tags": [
    "Introduction",
    "Module",
    "Image"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "Roundtrip"
  ],
  "description": "Welcome to the preview page ... and galleries.\n",
  "is_post": false
}
----

In this document, there are several fields, like `title`, `tagline`, or
`description`, that could be used for *full-text* searches. But additional
fields are available, like `tags` or `categories` that can be used for
more specific searches based on `identifiers`.

NOTE: The document *content* is collected by the (intrinsic) field `body`.
To limit the index data loaded by the browser, the body field is removed from
a document. The `body` field not available as an *explicit* field for searches,
but the *content* is still fully searchable.

To do a simple full-text search as well as more specific searches, the
QuickSearch core engine Lunr offers a query language, a DSL (domain-specific
language). Find more about *QuickSearch|Lunr DSL* queries with the section
<<Searching>>.

=== Scoring

The relevance (the `score`) is calculated based on an algorithm
called *BM25*, along with other factors. You don’t need to worry too much about
the details of how this technique works. To summarize: the more a search term
occurs in a single document, the more that term will increase that document’s
score, but the more a search term occurs in the *overall* collection of
documents, the less that term will increase a document’s score. In other words,
seldom words count and increase the score.

Scoring information generated by the BM25 algorithm is added to the (local)
search index and allows a very fast calculation of the relevance of documents
for queries.

Imagine you’re website contains documents about Jekyll. The term `Jekyll` may
occur very frequently throughout the entire website. Used quite often for the
content. So finding a document that mentions the term Jekyll isn’t very
significant for a search.

However, if you’re searching for `Jekyll Generator`, only some documents of
the website has the word `Generator` in them, and that will bring the score
(relevance) for documents having both words in them at a higher level,
bring them higher up in the search results.

Matching and scoring are used by all search engines - the same as for J1
QuickSearch. You’ll see for QuickSearch a similar behavior in *sorting*
search results as you already know from commercial internet search engines
like Google: the top results are the more relevant ones.

== Searching

To access QuickSearch, a magnifier button is available in the `Quicklinks`
area in the menu bar at the top-right of every page.

.Search button (magnifier) in the quick access area
lightbox::quicksearch-icon[ 800, {data-quicksearch-icon} ]

A mouse-click on the magnifier button opens the search input and disables
all other navigation to focus on what you're intended to do: searching.

.Input bar for a QuickSearch
lightbox::quicksearch-input[ 800, {data-quicksearch-input} ]

Search queries look like simple text. But the search `engine` under the
hood of QuickSearch transforms the given search string (text) always into a
search query. Search queries support a special syntax, the DSL, for defining
more complex queries for better (scored) results.

As always: start simple!

=== Simple searches

The simplest way to run a search is to pass the text (words, terms) on which
you want to search on:

[source, text]
----
jekyll
----

The above will return all documents that match the term `jekyll`. Searches for
*multiple* terms (words) are also supported. If a document matches *at least*
one of the search terms, it will show in the results. The search terms are
combined by a logical `OR`.

[source, text]
----
jekyll tutorial
----

The above example will match documents that contain either `jekyll` *OR*
`tutorial`. Documents that contain _both_ will increase the score, and those
documents are returned first.

NOTE: Comparing to a Google search (terms are combined at Google by a
logical `AND`) a Quicksearch combines the terms by an `OR`.

To combine search terms in a QuickSearch query by a logical *AND*, the terms
could be prepended by a plus sign (`+`) to mark them as for the QuickSearch
query (DSL) as *required*:

[source, text]
----
+jekyll +tutorial
----

=== Wildcards

QuickSearch supports wildcards when performing searches. A wildcard is
represented as an asterisk (`*`) and can appear anywhere in a search
term. For example, the following will match all documents with words
beginning with `Jek`:

[source, text]
----
jek*
----

NOTE: Language grammar rules are not relevant for searches. For simplification,
all words (terms) are transformed to lower case. As a result, the word
`Jekyll` is the same as `jekyll` from a search-engines perspective. Language
variations of `Jekyll's` or plurals like `Generators` are reduced
to their base form. For searches, don't take care of grammar rules but the
spelling. If you're unsure about the spelling of a word, use wildcards.


=== Fields

By default, Lunr will search *all fields* in a document for the given query
terms, and it is possible to restrict a term to a specific *field*. The
following example searches for the term `jekyll` in the field title:

[source, text]
----
title:jekyll
----

The search term is prefixed with the field's name, followed by a colon (`:`).
The field _must_ be one of the fields defined when building the index.
Unrecognized fields will lead to an error.

Search queries based on fields can be combined with all other term modifiers
like wildcards. For example, to search for words
beginning with `jek` in the title *AND* the wildcard `coll*` in a document,
the following query can be used:

[source, text]
----
+title:jek* +coll*
----

Besides the document *body*, an intrinsic field to create the full-text index
out of the document *content*, some more specific fields are available for
searches.

////
=== Boosts

In multi-term searches, a single term may be important than others. For
these cases Lunr supports term level boosts. Any document that matches a
boosted term will get a higher relevance score, and appear higher up in
the results. A boost is applied by appending a caret (`^`) and then a
positive integer to a term.

[source, javascript]
----
idx.search('foo^10 bar')
----

The above example weights the term “foo” 10 times higher than the term
“bar”. The boost value can be any positive integer, and different terms
can have different boosts:

[source, javascript]
----
idx.search('foo^10 bar^5 baz')
----

=== Fuzzy Matches

Lunr supports fuzzy matching search terms in documents, which can be
helpful if the spelling of a term is unclear, or to increase the number
of search results that are returned. The amount of fuzziness to allow
when searching can also be controlled. Fuzziness is applied by appending
a tilde (`~`) and then a positive integer to a term. The following
search matches all documents that have a word within 1 edit distance of
“foo”:

[source, javascript]
----
idx.search('foo~1')
----

An edit distance of 1 allows words to match if either adding, removing,
changing or transposing a character in the word would lead to a match.
For example “boo” requires a single edit (replacing “f” with “b”) and
would match, but “boot” would not as it also requires an additional “t”
at the end.
////

=== Term presence

By default, Lunr combines multiple terms in a search with a logical OR. That
is, a search for `jekyll collections` will match documents that contain
`jekyll` or contain `collections` or contain both. This behavior is
controllable at the term level, i.e., the presence of each term in matching
documents can be specified.

By default, each term is optional in a matching document, though a document
must have at least one matching term. It is possible to specify that a term
must be present in matching documents or that it must be absent in matching
documents.

To indicate that a term must be *present* in matching documents, the term
could be prefixed with a plus sign (`+`) (required), and to indicate that a
term  must be *absent* (not wanted), the term should be prefixed with a minus
(`-`).

The below example searches for documents that *must* contain `jekyll`, and
must *not* contain the word `collection`:

[source, text]
----
+jekyll -collection
----

To simulate a logical *AND* search of documents that contain the word `jekyll`
*AND* the word `collection`, mark both terms as required:

[source, text]
----
+jekyll +collection
----

== What next

You reached the end of the roundtrip. Hopefully you enjoyed exploring what J1
can do for your new website. To make things real for your site, go for
_J1 in a Day_.

J1 in a Day is a tutorial learning to create modern websites using the J1
Theme. This Tutorial focuses on the basics of Jekyll and J1, which all
people need to know for a successful way to a modern static website. Jekyll
(and J1) is quite different from classic Content Management Systems (CMS).

If you would like to learn more about the use of Jekyll and J1 Theme, the
tutorials present what you need to know:

* The basics of modern static webs
* Creating an awesome Site
* Development System
* Project Management
* Create Content

It sounds much, spending a whole day to get Jekyll and J1 to know. Yes, it is
much. But it makes sense to get a full overview of what can be achieved by
modern static websites.

It's a pleasant journey to learn what modern static webs can offer today.
