Welcome to the preview page focussing on image modules. This page shows
all of the powerful features of the J1 Template to manage your image-based
content using lightboxes, carousels, sliders, grids, and galleries.

The image-related modules of the J1 Template offer a wide range of complex
functionality based on powerful Open Source libraries like Lightbox Version 2,
lightGallery Version 2, Slick Slider, Master Slider, or Masonry and
Justified-Gallery to create masonry-styled preview maps.

== Lightboxes

A lightbox is a helper which displays enlarged, almost screen-filling versions
of images while dimming the remainder of the page. The technique, introduced
by Lightbox Version 2, gained widespread popularity thanks to its simple style.
The term *lightbox* has been employed since then for Javascript libraries to
support such functionality.

For J1 Template, different lightbox modules are available:

* Lightbox Version 2 (default)
* lightGallery Version 2 (optional)
* Slick Lightbox (optional, currently for Slick Carousels only)

The *default* tool employed by J1 Template is Lightbox V2, a Javascript
library written by _Lokesh Dhakar_ free to use for private or business
websites. For more complex use cases, like a thumbnail gallery preview or
video support, *lightGallery* can be used alternatively.

[CAUTION]
====
lightGallery is *free* to use based on a GPLv3 license for *non-business*
websites. If you have plans to use this lightbox for your business or on a
commercial site, you need to subscribe a so-called *Commercial License*. Find
more on the *paid* solution on the page:
https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/license[lightGallery license, {browser-window--new}].
====

All lightboxes are fully integrated to be used as standalone modules or
used as helpers *under-the-hood* by other modules focussing on image-data
like gallerys or carousels.

[TIP]
====
For details of the default lightbox of J1 Template, see the documentation
under the link:{url-j1-docs--lightbox-module}[Lightbox module, {browser-window--new}].
====

[role="mt-5"]
=== Default Lightbox

Find below an example of using the the default lightbox used for standalone
images. See how individual images are linked.

.Lightbox for standalone images
lightbox::example-standalone[ 800, {data-images-standalone}, role="mt-4 mb-4" ]

The J1 lightbox module supports groups of images as well. Click on the image
group below to see how a group is managed.

.Lightbox for grouped images
lightbox::example-group[ 395, {data-images-group}, group, role="mt-4 mb-4 wm-800" ]


[role="mt-5"]
=== lightGallery

lightGallery provides more complex image data functions than the default
lightbox. The module supports a gallery-style thumbnail preview plus image
resizing, a download dialog, sharing provider support, and more helpful.

[NOTE]
====
The name lightGallery implies a sort of a gallery, but the library is a
*lightbox*, and provides enhannced functionality on image-based data rather
than enlarged displaying of images.
====

Check what lightGallery can do this by the following example.

.J1 Gallery + lightGallery
gallery::jg_old_times[]

[role="mt-5"]
== J1 Carousel

J1 Carousel is based on OWL Carousel V1 in the latest version. The carousel
is a powerful jQuery plugin for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled
carousel slideshows.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Simple Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A slider or carousel is typically used for displaying images. Still, the
implementation for the J1 Template supports a lot more sources to be
displayed as a slide show -- simple text for example.

.Text Carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-4"]

Important statements or topics can be placed on top of an article or
a paragraph to give them better visibility. In one line, you can present
many facts to know animated for the reader's attention within a single
line.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Parallax Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A more emphasized type of text-based carousel is a parallax text slider. If
you want to focus the meaning, this kind of a slide show may be interesting.
Image-based slide shows may draw off the reader's attention from the text,
therefore a pure text-based presentation maybe the better choice.

.Parallax Text
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-4"]

Parallax text shows can be placed as banners on a page. For text shows,
different animations are available. Internally, J1 Template uses some of
the great CSS styles offered by _animate.css_.

[TIP]
====
Have a look a https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/[Dan Eden's home page, {browser-window--new}]
to see all the possible dynamic styles you can create based on pure CSS.
Some of them are implemented for the J1 Carousel for animation. See the
documentation for the
link:{url-j1-docs--carousel-module}[Carousel module, {browser-window--new}]
for more details.
====

[role="mt-5"]
=== Simple Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.
Find with the following some examples of how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A simple image show is useful, for example, as an animated (or not animated)
banner presenting exciting things about your site or the products offered.

.Image Carousel
carousel::demo_simple[role="mb-5"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Carousel + Caption + Lightbox

Carousels are used for an exceptionally compact form of image galleries.
This example shows some pictures having individual caption text and supports
a lightbox to enlarge images full size.

.Image Carousel + Lightbox
carousel::demo_cats[role="mb-3"]

The J1 module lightbox is a simple Lightbox but offers a bunch of impressive
features for displaying images. For example, the lightbox can display all
images as a group. If one picture is opened in the lightbox, others are
browsed by easy-to-use control buttons.

[role="mt-4"]
=== One Slide Carousel + Lightbox

The build-in carousel supports multiple and single image shows. Here you find
an example of a single image slide show with controls enabled to browse all
images back and forth. An indicator below the slider shows how many images
the show contains.

.One Slide Carousel
carousel::demo_oneslide[role="mb-4"]

[role="mt-5"]
== J1 Slick Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
Slick is a popular jQuery plugin for creating responsive and fully
customizable carousels. It allows developers to easily create beautiful
and dynamic carousels that can display images, videos, or any other type
of content in a visually appealing way.

The plugin is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it
a popular choice for all web developers. It has many features, including
multiple navigation options, lazy loading, or autoplay. Slick carousels are
compatible with all modern browsers and devices, making it a great choice to
create a responsive and mobile-friendly website.

All Slick carousels for the J1 Template can be easily customized in
various ways, such as changing the number of posts displayed, the slider
speed, or the navigation options like *Arrows* and *Dots*.

[role="mt-4"]
[[slick-image-carousel]]
=== Image Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
An _Slick_ image carousel typically consists of a container with images and
a navigation system, including buttons, arrows, or dots that allow users to
move back and forth between images or select a specific image. Image carousels
can also include animation effects, such as fade-in or slide-in transitions
between images, to make the presentation more engaging and visually appealing.

.Carousel + Arrows + Dots + Captions + Lightbox
slick::image_carousel_full[]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Carousel from Collections

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel from a collection for J1 Template is a *pre-defined* element
type to display *articles* from a Jekyll collection on a webpage. All
carousels for collections display the article image and a link to the article
as a caption.

.Collection Biography + Arrows + Dots + Gutters
slick::collection_carousel_biography[]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Carousel from Posts

A Carousel from posts for J1 Template is a *pre-defined* carousel type to
display post articles on a webpage. It is a popular way to showcase a
selection of post articles visually appealingly and can be useful for
highlighting important or *featured* content for your posts content.

[role="mb-4"]
Post carousels pull news articles from a specific *group*. All Carousels for
posts display the post category, the title, the author information and
date.

[role="mt-5"]
[[masterSlider]]
== Masterslider

Masterslider is a jQuery plugin fully integrated into the J1 Template.
Jekyll One uses the *free* version of Masterslider well-known as MS Lite.
The lite version does *not* support all features of the full product.
The functionality of filters and  layouts are limited and no overlay
techniques are supported by the MS Lite version.

[role="mt-4"]
[[carousel_versus_slider]]
=== Carousel versus Slider

Sliders and Carousels are focussing quite the same thing: presenting images
dynamically. The features of Sliders go far beyond what simple carousels can
do: presenting image-based data as slide *shows*.

Well-known Office Products to create *presentations* are Powerpoint from
_Microsoft_ or _Google Docs_. Modern sliders like _Master Slider_ provide
similar features to present animated presentations based on digital image
data combined with text elements, buttons, or overlay techniques for images
or other digital data sources.

In short: Carousels are used to present images, and sliders are used to create
complex image-based presentations.

[TIP]
====
For more details of the implementation of Master Slider for J1 Template, find
more helpful information at the page
link:{url-j1-docs--masterslider-module}[Master Slider module, {browser-window--new}].
====

[role="mt-5"]
=== Featured MS Slider

The following slider uses the CSS filter feature of Master Slider. Filters
can be used, for example, to *transform* the *style* of the images presented
by a slider. In this example, the slider images are transformed from style
*color* to *sepia*.

[WARNING]
====
Lightbox support is only available for the MS Lite version of J1 Template.
The original Product versions *MS Lite* and *MS Pro* does not support
lightboxes on sliders out-of-the-box.
====

.Slider using Controls + Filters + Lightbox
masterslider::ms_00002[role="mt-4 mb-4"]

[TIP]
====
Click on the Lightbox symbol mdi:image-outline[18px, md-gray] in the
slides to see the *colored* images configured for the slider.
====

[role="mt-5"]
[[text_elements]]
=== MS Slider using Text Elements

One of the major features of sliders is to present additional animated
elements, like text data, connected to the images presented by an slideshow.
MS Slider additionally provides functions to combine images and text by
so-called *MSInfo* blocks out-of-the-box.

.Slider using Images + Text
masterslider::ms_00003[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

[role="mt-4"]
[[thumb_images]]
=== Slider using Thumb Elements

To give the users better control over a slideshow, sliders provide complex UI
elements to place dor example mini-images or short text elements side-by-side
left or right, or at the bottom of a slideshow. Find two examples below how
to control such a carousel element.

.Image controls
masterslider::ms_00004[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

.Text controls
masterslider::ms_00007[role="mt-4 mb-5"]


[role="mt-4"]
[[partialview]]
=== MS Slider using Layout PartialView

The following slider presents a slideshow that combines an MSInfo element
at the bottom and the MS Layout `partialview`. A slideshow typically presents
a larger number of slides. The layout `partialview` accompanies the active
slide by their neighbors on the left and the right.

.Slider using PartialView
masterslider::ms_00009[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

[role="mt-5"]
== J1 Masonry

Masonry for J1 is a great tool to create dynamic image galleries. Image
galleries are popular on many websites, and masonry can be a useful tool for
creating dynamic galleries.

By using the Masonry module, you can create a gallery that displays images of
different sizes in an aesthetically pleasing and functional way.

.Masonry Grid of Images + Lightbox
masonry::image_fixed_height_lb[role="mt-4 mb-4"]

[TIP]
====
Find more on how the Masonry module can be used on the
link:{url-j1-masonry-previewer}[Masonry Preview, {browser-window--new}] page.
====


[role="mt-5"]
== J1 Gallery

link:{url-justified-gallery--home}[JustifiedGallery, {browser-window--new}]
is a great _jQuery_ Plugin to create responsive, infinite, and high-quality
justified image galleries. J1 Template combines the Gallery with the lightboxes
supported to enlarge the images of a gallery. See the gallery in action; and
for sure, all that you see is even responsive. Change the size of your current
browser window, by width or height to see what will happen!

[role="mb-4"]
Pictures you've made are typically not even in size. Images may have the
same size (resolution), but some are orientated landscapes, or others
may be portraits. For that reason, a more powerful gallery is needed to create
so-called justified views. J1 Gallery is based on Justified Gallery to create
so-called masonry grid layouts.

It works by placing elements in an optimal position based on available
horizontal and vertical space. Sort of like mason fitting stones in a wall.
For sure, you'll have seen it in action all over the Internet.

[role="mt-5"]
== What next

I hope, you've enjoyed exploring the possibilities J1 offers for managing
and displaying digital image content. But much, much more can the J1 do for
your web.

The J1 Template support playing video on web pages by using the HTML5 video
support, the new standard of HTML. HTML5 video implements a pure HTML way to
show videos on the web. Modern browsers support the video tag `<video>` for
the HTML5 standard. The previous proprietary de facto standard software like
a Flash Player, Quicktime, or Silverlight is no longer needed as the Theme
JekyllOne provides HTML5 video for local content and from online sources on
the Internet.
