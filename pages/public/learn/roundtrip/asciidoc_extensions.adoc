J1 Theme implements some handy Ruby-based enhancements for Asciidoctor.
Providing extensions for a Jekyll theme is a unique feature of JekyllOne
compared to other Jekyll themes and templates. All already implemented
Asciidoctor extensions you'll find below. Additional valuable extensions
to the markup language Asciidoc is made especially for documents of the
Jekyll content type pages, but can be used for posts or collections as well.

TIP: Most extensions are based on well-documented examples from the
link:{url-asciidoctor--extensions-lab}[Asciidoctor Extensions Lab, {browser-window--new}].
To create Asciidoc extensions on your own, it is highly recommended to read the
link:{url-asciidoctor--extensions-manual}[extensions section, {browser-window--new}] in
the Asciidoctor user manual.

// Include sub-documents (if any)

== Asciidoc Result Extension

J1 Theme adds a simple Javascript based on the `View Result Extension` to
any `listingblock`. The extension adds an interactive toggle button `VIEW`
to the output of an Asciidoc listing block box placed to the top right of
the example box. If a result block `[.result]` is placed under a `listingblock`,
clicking the toggle button `VIEW` displays (or hide) the content given by the
`result block`.

The `View Result Extension` is quite helpful for sections discussing
Asciidoc code and how the resulting (HTML) code would look alike.

.This example place a button `VIEW` top right of the example box
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
* displayed always
----

== Asciidoc Admonitions

Admonition blocks draw attention to certain statements by taking them out
of the contentâ€™s flow and labeling them as priorities. These types of
(Asciidoc) blocks are called admonitions. The AsciiDoc language provides
five admonition types represented by the following labels:

.Admonition labels
[cols="3a,9a", subs=+macros, options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===
|Name |Description

|`NOTE`
|Additional information on the currently discussed topic that may help
the reader

|`TIP`
|Additional information on the currently discussed topic that may help the
reader *to go further* or describe *additional options* available

|`IMPORTANT`
|Emphasis on what is currently being discussed and facts that should
be kept in mind

|`CAUTION`
|Advise the reader to act carefully and point to potential tripping

|`WARNING`
|inform the reader of danger, harm, or consequences that exist

|===

NOTE: All colors for all default admonition blocks set to the standard
MD color set. Find available block types and their colors below.


When you want to call attention to a single paragraph, start the first
line of the paragraph with the label you want to use. The label must be
uppercase and followed by a colon (:).

.Admonition paragraph syntax
[source, config]
----
NOTE: Followed by the paragraph text
----

Set the label as a style attribute on a block when you want to apply an
admonition to complex content. The next example shows that admonition
labels are commonly set on example blocks. The label must be uppercase
when set as an attribute on a block.

.CAUTION block
CAUTION: Icon background-color: red


== Asciidoc Quote elements

Quote elements cite a passage or phrase from a book, speech, or the like,
such as authority, illustration, etc. the quote elements are controlled by
the following *attributes*:

attribution::
The attribute `attribution` specifies the name of *who* the content
is attributed to

information::
The attribute `information` is optional and specifies the general or
bibliographical information of the book, speech, play, poem, etc.,
where the content was *drawn from*

=== Quoted paragraph

If the text element to be quoted is a single line or paragraph, the attribute
list `[quote, attribution, information]` can be placed directly *above* the
text.

.Synopsis
[source, text]
----
[quote, attribution, information]
Quote or excerpt text
----

Example of a quoted *paragraph*:

[quote, Captain James T. Kirk, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]
Everybody remember where we parked.

A *single* paragraph can be turned into a blockquote by:

. surrounding the quoted paragraph with double-quotes (")
. adding an (optional) `attribution`, prefixed by two dashes (--)
  *below* the quoted text

.Synopsis
[source, text]
----
"quoted paragraph"
-- attribution
----

"I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,
and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
-- Thomas Jefferson, Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Volume 11


=== Quote block

If the text element (or excerpt) to be quoted is more than one paragraph,
place the (multine) text between delimiter lines consisting of four
*underscores* (____).

.Synopsis

[source, text]
----
[quote, attribution]
____
paragraph text (multiline)
____
----

Example of a quoted *block*:

[quote, Monty Python and the Holy Grail]
____
Dennis: Come and see the violence inherent in the system.
Help! Help! I'm being repressed!

King Arthur: Bloody peasant!

Dennis: Oh, what a giveaway! Did you hear that? Did you hear that, eh?
That's what I'm on about! Did you see him repressing me? You saw him,
Didn't you?

== Lightboxes

A Lightbox is, in general, a helper which displays enlarged, almost
screen-filling versions of images (or videos) while dimming the remainder
of the page. The technique, introduced by Lightbox V2, gained widespread
popularity thanks to its simple style. The term lightbox has been employed
since then for Javascript libraries to support such functionality.

To make the use of the built-in lightbox easier, the J1 Theme offers an
Asciidoc extension: the lightBox block macro. The block macro `lightbox::`
embeds one or more images into the output document and puts the default
lightbox for J1 automatically on. The images `size` (width) and additional
`caption text` and additional CSS styles are configurable for all images
using this macro.

.Lightbox block for single images
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
.block_title
lightbox::<block_id>[ <images_width>, <images_data_id>, <role="<additional CSS styles>"> ]
----

.Lightbox block for image groups
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
.block_title
lightbox::<block_id>[ <images_width>, <images_data_id>, <group_name>, <role="<additional CSS styles>"> ]
----

[NOTE]
====
The `role` parameter to specify additional CSS styles is for all `lightbox::`
macros *optional* and can be omitted.

For a `lightbox::` block, images are placed in the output document
without any other scaling than in width - they are placed using simple
HTML `img` tags. This technique is fine for images that are even in size.
For images in different sizes, a gallery should be used as a J1 Gallery Apps
to rearrange images and make them fit at their best for the available space.
====

=== Standalone Images

For your convenience and better readability, the image data should be
defined as Asciidoc attributes. The image data is given as a string
of data pairs:

.Paired attributes
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
"path/to/image-1, image-caption-1, ..."
----

.Example of an data attribute for a lightbox block
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
:data-images: "pages/image-1.jpg, Description 1, "pages/image-2.jpg, Description 2"
----

The base path for all image-related data is a side-wide (Asciidoc)
configuration (see `_config.yml`) and points per default to `/assets/images`.
The base path is automatically added to each image. If you want to use the
default asset path for images, a relative path needs to be given for
`path/to/image`.

WARNING: If an absolute path is configured, like `/path/to/image`, the base
path gets ignored - this is the default behavior of the Asciidoc Markup
processor. If an absolute path is given, the full path to the images
used has to be configured.

The parameter `group` for the `lightbox::` block is an option. If no
`group` parameter is given for a block, the related images are treated as
standalone.

.Lightbox block for standalone images
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
lightbox::<block_id>[ 800, {<data-images-id>} ]
----

.Lightbox block for standalone images
lightbox::images-standalone[ 800, {data-images-standalone} ]

=== Grouped Images

If more than a single image is given for a `lightbox::` block, the images
can be grouped to enable a simple sliding functionality through this group
of related images. Enabling this function, the option `group` needs to be
configured for the block.

.Lightbox block for grouped images
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
lightbox::<block_id>[ 400, {<data-images-group_id>}, <group_name> ]
----

.Lightbox block for grouped images
lightbox::images-group[ 400, {data-images-group}, group_name ]

== Galleries

JustifiedGallery, the default gallery for J1, is a great jQuery plugin to
create responsive, infinite, and high-quality justified image galleries.
J1 Theme combines the Gallery with the lightboxes supported to enlarge
the images of a gallery.

Pictures youâ€™ve made are typically not even in size. Images may have the same
size (resolution), but some are orientated landscapes, or others may be
portrait. For that reason, a more powerful gallery is needed to create
a so-called masonry grid layout. It works by placing elements in an optimal
position based on available horizontal and vertical space. Sort of like mason
fitting stones in a wall.

.Gallerie macro for images and videos
[source, no_template]

=== Video galleries

== Country flags

Country flags are often used in the context of language-specific selections
or for content related to a specific country. The use of country flags can
make language selections or country indicators more visual to support your
visitors by making a more meaningful presentation.

The J1 Theme comes with full support of country flags for Asciidoc
documents included.

Country flags can be used as inline icons by using the `flag:` inline macro:

[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
flag:country[style, size, modifier] <1> <2> <3> <4>
----
<1> All `country` flags can be found on the preview page for
    link:{url-previewer--county-flags}[country flags]
<2> The `style` attribute can be one of: `rectangle` or `squared`
<3> The `size` attribute can be one of: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` (responsive)
    and `1x` to `10x` (proportional)
<4> The `modifier` can be used to add individual CSS classes e.g. for
    BS styles for margin setting and other

.Click on button `VIEW` to see how it's looks alike
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
----
flag:de[rectangle, 2x, ml-3 mr-2 mb-2] Germany (rectangle) +
flag:de[squared, 2x, ml-3 mr-3 mb-2] Germany (square)
----

[.result]
====
flag:de[rectangle, 2x, ml-3 mr-2 mb-2] Germany (rectangle) +
flag:de[squared, 2x, ml-3 mr-3 mb-2] Germany (square)
====

Flag Icons is a collection of all country flags in the SVG vector format.
All icons can be automatically resized with no loss in display quality.

.Example flag sizes (responsive)

== Blind Text (Lorem)

The Ruby Gem Middleman, a Ruby-based static site generator, provides a
set of great helpers for generating random text content. The Lorem
inline macro `lorem:` adapted this functionality from Middleman to use
Asciidoc-based documents processed by Jekyll.

If you start writing larger documents with several chapters, not all of the
content is available initially. It is quite useful to place blind text
first to get a better impression of how a page will look-alike that is not
finished yet.

Placeholders for blind text comes in several flavors given by `macro`. The
syntax for the `lorem:` inline macro is simple like this:

[source, no_template]
----
lorem:macro[]
lorem:macro[size]
----

.Example of a lorem sentences macro
[source, no_template, role="noclip"]
