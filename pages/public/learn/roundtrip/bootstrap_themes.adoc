                                        J1 Theme offers various unique functionalities compared to other Jekyll
                                        themes and templates. Bootstrap themes for the J1 Theme are based on the
                                        free and open-source CSS front-end framework Bootstrap of version V5. The
                                        Bootstrap themes for the J1 enable the presentation of different versions
                                        (skins) of the same site using already prepared Bootstrap CSS templates.

Bootstrap styles for the J1 are based on the free and open-source CSS front-end
framework of version V5. The Bootstrap theme feature enables the presentation
of different versions of the same site using already prepared Bootstrap CSS
styles.

link:{url-bs--home}[Bootstrap, {browser-window--new}] is an HTML, CSS and
Javascripts Library that focuses on simplifying the development of modern web
pages. The primary purpose of applying the framework to J1 is to provide a
general standard for colors, sizes, fonts, and the overall layout of a
J1-based site.

Using Bootstrap themes results in a uniform appearance for the content in
terms of the overall layout, text, tables, and form elements across all
modern web browsers available on the market. In addition, developers can
take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to customize content
individually.

== What next

The search option for the J1 Theme is based on the search engine Lunr and
is fully integrated with the template. Lunr is designed to be lightweight
yet full-featured to provide users with a great search experience. Using
Lunr for a Jekyll website, there is no need to integrate complex external,
server-sided search engines like Google or Bing.

Visitors should be able to search your site to find pages and posts they
are interested in. Usability is one of the top criteria for all visitors
browsing your site. A good user experience and excellent content are key
factors for the success of a website. Nothing in this business is guaranteed,
but user experience efforts are good reasons your readers will return.
