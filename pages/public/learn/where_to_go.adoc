Welcome to the pages of the J1-Template. If you are here the first time, a
good decision you get on that page first. For sure, there is no better place
to go. The crucial first step in finding your way to Jekyll is done.
Congratulations. The *Learn* section contains all you need to learn what
Jekyll and J1 can do for your website, for your new static web - if you like.

Roundtrip::
In this section, you’ll find a tour to show some of the main features of
the template system J1. This trip covers how image data can be managed using
J1, some background of the Template’s typography, discuss extensions, and
what J1 can do in general. The roundtrip is a visual tour, no technical stuff,
nothing academic. See what you will get as an overview of some of the top
features of J1.

If you're interested what J1 Template can do, continue by walking through the
roundtrip examples by starting an inspiring tour
link:{url-j1-roundtrip--present-images}[from here].

////
Jupyter Notebooks::
In section *Jupyter Notebooks*, you'll find a tour through the J1 Implementation
of the integration of Python's Jupyter Notebooks in J1 Websites for *Data Science*
and *Data Analysis*. Data Science is fundamental for all projects related to
all *Digitization* concepts of the 21st century. If you're interested, what
tools are available with J1 Template and Jupyter to discuss (your) *Data Analysis*
projects go for this section.

To learn more about the toolset for presenting *Data Analysis* projects supported
by J1 Template start the tour link:{url-j1-jupyter-notebooks--where-to-go}[from here].

Rocketstart::
J1-Template is fully JAM-Stack ready. If you're interested in creating and
deploying an amazing J1 based site on the Internet in minutes without
installing any software locally on your PC, go for Netlify's One-Click-Deploy.

Rocketstart took about fifteen minutes and guides you through this easy
3-step-process. Fire your rocket now at
link:{url-j1--rocketstart}[Rocketstart, {browser-window--new}].

J1 in a Day::
J1 in a Day is a tutorial learning to create modern websites using the J1
Template. This Tutorial focuses on the basics of Jekyll and J1, which all
people need to know for a successful way to a modern static website. Jekyll
(and J1) is quite different from classic Content Management Systems (CMS).

If you would like to learn more about the use of Jekyll and J1-Template, the
tutorials present what you need to know:

* The basics of modern static webs
* Creating an awesome Site
* Development System
* Project Management
* Create Content

It sounds much, spending a whole day to get Jekyll and J1 to know. Yes, it is
much. But it makes sense to get a full overview of what can be achieved by
modern static websites.

To experience what's possible today using modern websites static webs, go for
link:{url-j1-web-in-a-day--meet-and-greet}[J1 in a Day, {browser-window--new}].
