Welcome to the info pages of J1 Theme. A good decision to get on that page
first. Certainly, there is no better place to learn what J1 Theme can do
and what pages are available to experience more.

The crucial first step in finding your way to Jekyll is done. Congratulations.
The *Learn* section contains all you need to learn what Jekyll and J1 can do
for your website, for your new static web - if you like.

Roundtrip::
In this section, you’ll find a tour to show some of the main features of
the J1 theme. This trip covers how image data can be managed using
J1, some background of the Theme's typography, discuss extensions, and
what J1 can do in general. The roundtrip is a visual tour, no technical
stuff, nothing academic. See what you will get as an overview of some of
the top features of J1.

If you're interested what J1 Theme can do, continue by walking through the
roundtrip examples by starting an inspiring tour

Rocketstart::
J1 Theme is fully JAM-Stack ready. If you're interested in creating and
deploying an amazing J1 based site on the Internet in minutes without
installing any software locally on your PC, go for Netlify's One-Click-Deploy.
Rocketstart took about fifteen minutes and guides you through this easy
3-step-process. Fire your rocket now at
link:{url-j1--rocketstart}[Rocketstart, {browser-window--new}].

Site Development::
The tutorial link:{url-j1--devstart}[Site Development, {browser-window--new}]
accompanies you to learn how to set up a development environment for Jekyll
and J1 Theme to manage and create your first website locally on your PC in
minutes. J1 Theme comes with a built-in Web, a skeleton for a new website created
using Jekyll. This website is called the `Starter Web`, a general-purpose
scaffold for modifying a new site for your needs.

J1 in a Day::
The workshop `J1 in a Day` is a tutorial learning to create modern websites
using _Jekyll_ and the J1 Theme. This Tutorial focuses on the basics of
_Jekyll_ and J1, which all people need to know for a successful way to a
modern static website. Jekyll (and JekyllOne) is quite different from classic
Content Management Systems (CMS).

If you would like to learn more about the use of Jekyll and J1 Theme, the
tutorials present what you need to know:

* The basics of modern static webs
* Creating an awesome Site
* Development System
* Project Management
* Create Content

It sounds much, spending a whole day to get Jekyll and J1 to know. Yes, it is
much. But it makes sense to get a full overview of what can be achieved by
modern static websites.
