Welcome to the pages of the J1 Template. If you are here the first time, a
good decision you get on that page first. For sure, there is no better place
to go. The crucial first step in finding your way to Jekyll is done.
Congratulations. The *Learn* section contains all you need to learn what
Jekyll and J1 can do for your website.

For your new static web. If you like.

Quickstart::
For experienced people familiar with using Jekyll, the *Quickstart* section
may help start by creating a Starter Web. The build-in website for J1. This
article gives an overview of what software is needed and how to run the
base (web development) commands for:

* creating a J1 project
* setting up your run-time
* (re-)build a web
* run a web

Setting up a J1 project and creating the first website using J1 will take
about 15 minutes. But, you should know what you are doing!

Go for link:{url-j1--quickstart}[the quick start, {browser-window--new}]!

Roundtrip::
In this section, you’ll find a tour to show some of the main features of
the template system J1. This trip covers how image data can be managed using
J1, some background of the Template’s typography, discuss extensions, and
what J1 can do in general. The roundtrip is a visual tour, no technical stuff,
nothing academic. See what you will get as an overview of some of the top
features of J1.

If you like, continue by walking through the roundtrip examples
