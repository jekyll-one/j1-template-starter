The J1 Template system supports playing video on web pages using native HTML5,
the current standard. Visitors can play video files without the need for an
external player.

Modern browsers support the video tag `<video>`. The previous proprietary
software, like _Flash Player_, _Quicktime_, _Silverlight_ is no longer required
as the J1 Template provides video support for local video files and online
sources.

// See: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/audio-and-video/
//
HTML5 video opens the doors to present local video content on your
website. All modern browsers support the video tag `<video>.` This Browsers
have a built-in multimedia framework for decoding and displaying video content.

Two types of video sources are supported:

* Video from local folders from your webspace
* Video from online sources like YouTube

Standalone video players embedded in websites are software components that
integrate and play video sources directly within a web page. These players
are essential for all current websites. Embedded players provide a seamless
and user-friendly way to present multimedia content to your audience.

[role="mb-4"]
All modern browsers universally support the video tag `<video>`. This tag
offers an out-of-the-box framework for decoding and displaying video content
without loading *external players*.

the video content you want to present on your site. You can place galleries
elsewhere with your content. You can use them for blogs by putting them into
your article's content.

[CAUTION]
====
The module lightGallery can be used for free for private use, but a
*commercial license* is required for business or commercial websites. See
link:{url-light-gallery--license}[LightGallery Licenses, {browser-window--new}]

The example below demonstrates playing only the *Audio* track from YouTube

YouTube files for the audio part.

[role="mt-4 mb-4"]
[CAUTION]
====
Playing audio tracks is currently supported only for videos from YouTube (YT).
The YT plugin *ytp* embeds a YouTube (iframe) player and mimics the AmplitudeJS

== What next

Images and videos are pretty visual, and they can be impressive, for sure.
However, the most visual component on all web pages is text for all sites
on the Internet.

Sadly, one common flaw in many templates and frameworks is a lack of support
for *responsive text*. While other elements on a page resize fluidly, the
text is still fixed. To avoid this issue, especially for heavily text-focused
pages, the J1 Template supports a fluidly scaled text that changes
in size and line height to optimize readability for the user.

The JekyllOne Template J1 places the character font as one of the most crucial
*branding elements* for any website. Typography matters for any media presenting
text. The text will take on an important role of acting as plain text and as
something like images. To see how text could be presented is great for modern
responsive websites.

[role="mb-7"]
