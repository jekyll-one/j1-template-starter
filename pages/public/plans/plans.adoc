== Plans

Service plans are typically contracts or agreements between a service provider
and a customer, outlining the terms and conditions of a particular service or
set of services that will be provided.

Service plans may include details such as the scope of the service, the level
of support provided, the duration of the contract, the payment terms, and any
additional fees or charges. Some service plans may also include warranties or
guarantees, outlining what the customer can expect regarding quality or
reliability.
