== Platforms

J1 Theme is based on these popular software platforms:

mdi:language-ruby[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Ruby>> >= 2.7 +
mdi:language-ruby[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Jekyll>> 4.3 +
mdi:nodejs[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<NodeJS>> 14.x

All software-platforms are OpenSource, free to use and available on all
common operating systems like Windows, Linux, and OSX.

=== Ruby

For the latest versions of J1 Theme (>= *2022.5.0*), Ruby V3 is recommended.
The latest Ruby versions offer much better run-time performance. Ruby 3 will
be up to three times faster compared to Ruby 2.0. This will definively
speed-up the development processes for your new website.

=== Jekyll

The latest version of
http://jekyllrb.com/news/2022/10/20/jekyll-4-3-0-released/[Jekyll v4.3.0 (October 2022), {browser-window--new}]
including all fixes for version V4. The upcoming version *v4.3.0* will offer
some new features and modernized functionality. If this version is released,
all new features will be implemented in J1 as well.

=== NodeJS

Websites created by Jekyll One are projects managed by NodeJS. The built-in
script engine provided by the package manager `npm` of NodeJS simplifies the
management of J1 projects a lot. Well-known commands typically used to manage
software projects are at your fingertips. Easy to learn, easy to remember.
Simple commands support creators to concentrate on the content.

== Frameworks

To no reinvent wheels, J1 Theme is based on ready-to-use frameworks,
extensions, and modules. All build-in frameworks are industry standard,
well known, and accepted worldwide.

mdi:bootstrap[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Bootstrap V5>> +
mdi:language-html5[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Internet Standards Supported>> (HTML5, CSS and Javascript) +
mdi:grass[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Icon Fonts>> +
mdi:application-settings[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
<<Fully Configurable>> +

=== Bootstrap V5

For current webs, a must: responsiveness and modern design. Jekyll One is
based on Bootstrap V5, the leading platform to create today's responsive
webs.

=== Internet Standards Supported

Professional websites on the internet define standards. All current sites
support dynamic, fast loading, and some more features. For fastest loading,
all HTML, CSS, and Javascript have been compressed automatically for production.
Going further for dynamic, AJAX loading for J1 webs is supported as well.

=== Icon Fonts

No question, icons and icon fonts are essentially required to make a site
better understandable. Icons are used for navigation, extensions, modules,
and last but not least for the content.

J1 Theme supports popular icons font sets out-of-the-box:

* link:{url-mdi--home}[Material Design Icons, {browser-window--new}] (MDI)
* link:{url-fontawesome--home}[FontAwesome Icons V5, {browser-window--new}] (FAI)
* link:{url-iconify--home}[Iconify Icons, {browser-window--new}] (ICI)

All the icon sets are excellent in design and have a rich set of icons in
various categories typically used for the Web.

=== Fully Configurable

Software products of today are not easy to manage. To get the complexity
out of your way, J1 is fully configurable. No need to dive in the deep.

    type:             text

The Web is everywhere. J1 Theme supports modern web browsers on all devices
for best results on PCs, Tablets, and SmartPhones.

=== Desktop and Mobile support

The internet has shifted from almost exclusively desktop-driven to mostly
mobile-driven nowadays. Just a decade ago, in 2010, over 90 percent of all
global web traffic came from desktop computers. The percentage of global web
traffic on mobile phones has surged over the past decade. As of July 2021,
more than 50 percent of all web traffic came through mobile devices.

.Global mobile traffic, 2011-2021
lightbox::broadbandsearch--global-mobile-traffic[ 800, {data-broadbandsearch--global-mobile-traffic} ]

Source: link:{url-broadbandsearch--mobile-internet-usage}[broadbandsearch.net, {browser-window--new}]

As of 2021, more than 50 percent of the total web visits are currently mobile.
For this reason, it is very important to provide good useability of your
website for mobile devices.

=== Desktop Web Navigation

Then Naviagtion Modules of J1 Theme provides multiple sub-modules. An very
important one: the menu system. Based on a quite simple configuration, give
your vistors easy access to all of your content pages on a mouse-click.

    - title:                            Where to go
      href:                             /pages/public/learn/where_to_go/
      icon:                             paw

.Desktop Web Navigation
lightbox::images--desktop-navigation[ 800, {data-images--desktop-navigation} ]

=== Mobile Web Navigation

Mobile devices are great for Apps designed for these platforms. Using a web
browser to surf websites is often frustrating on mobiles. Jekyll One provides
navigation systems that cover both worlds: desktops and mobiles.

.Mobile Web Navigation
lightbox::images--mobile-navigation[ 400, {data-images--mobile-navigation} ]

IMPORTANT: Desktop and Mobile Navigation is using the **same** configuration
data (`navigator_menu.yml`). The automatically generated menus for Desktop and
Mobile Devices are displayed based on the size of the viewport.


=== Best Google Lighthouse Scores

Performance is a key factor for all users. To not get visitors lost, J1 webs
are highly optimized. All Websites will achieve the  best Google Lighthouse
scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO at the green
level.
