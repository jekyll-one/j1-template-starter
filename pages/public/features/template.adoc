For Jekyll, a huge number of templates are available that cover all typical
use cases for websites. The bad story: most of them require programming and
low-level customization. Deep knowledge of Jekyll and valuable experience
using HTML, CSS, and Javascript is required.

J1 is different: easy to use, no programming is needed.

// Include sub-documents (if any)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Modules

The Template provides a large number of building blocks to create modern
web pages in minutes. The base idea of the J1 Theme is to give all people
a toolset at their hands to create a website with no need to start web
development or web design from the beginning.

=== Infinite scroll

Infinite scrolling (IS), or known as endless scrolling, is a technique that
loads more content as a user scrolls down the page. It allows visitors to
continue reading the content by scrolling seamlessly and not by loading
additional pages.

J1 Theme supports infinite scrolling and is used, for example, for loading
previews of blog articles.

=== Animate on scroll

Scroll-triggered animation (AOS) is an effective way to animate website
elements such as text, graphics, photos, and video, bringing them to life
as users scroll down a page. Scroll animations are more likely to grab the
user's attention, making websites look and feel more dynamic and
interesting.

=== Floating Action Buttons

The *Floating Action Button* (FAB) is an element of Google's Material Design.
A FAB represents the primary action in an application, or triggers additional
functions for a webpage. FABs are increasingly used on the web and serves to
enable important actions for a page, but separated from the main navigation.

.FAB (Menu)
lightbox::images--fab[ 800, {data-images--fab} ]

The template system supports Floating Action Buttons for in-page navigation.
When the FAB is pressed, it provides more related actions like showing the
content table or scrolling a page chapter-wise up and down.

=== Full-text search engine

Full-text search (FTS) for a website is an advanced method of searching
through all documents. FTS promises fast retrieval of data with advanced
indexing and more intuitive search results based on relevance.

.Full-text search
lightbox::images--full-text-search[ 800, {data-images--full-text-search} ]

J1 implements Lunr for indexing the whole website. The engine is designed
to be small but full-featured. Lunr enables developers to provide visitors
with a great search experience without the need for external, server-sided
search services like Google on the internet.

=== Cookie Consent

Running websites in the EU and many other countries, implementing the
*General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR) is required to make a website
compliant with the *ePrivacy* regulations of the European Unions and
associated countries.

.Cookie Consent
lightbox::images--cookie-consent[ 800, {data-images--cookie-consent} ]

Under the GDPR, *most cookies* will fall into the category of *personal data*
because they can identify visitors and can be used to provide website
personalization and even profiling of individuals. As a result, you will
need a *legal basis* for processing the data contained within those cookies.
That legal basis is most likely going to be the CONSENT of your visitors on
accepting the use of cookies.

The Template system provides a configurable GDPR compliant module to manage
the consent of your visitors on cookies.

=== Translator

A Website translation service is useful in a wide range of situations.
In today’s interconnected and global world English is no longer enough.
Most online content is still written in English, while the language is
just ranked 3rd in terms of the highest number of native speakers among all
languages worldwide.

.Native speakers by language
lightbox::lingohub--speakers-by-language[ 600, {data-lingohub--speakers-by-language} ]

Source: link:{url-lingohub--speakers-by-language}[lingohub.com, {browser-window--new}]

In 2015 it was necessary to support 25 languages to reach 90 percent of the
entire Internet population in their native language. By 2020, a website will
require localization into 48 languages to reach the same proportion of the
global Internet audience.

Localization adapts a website to cultural backgrounds and local languages.
Translation makes it easier for users to browse content and find what they’re
looking for. An excellent user experience and understanding the language are
key for building trust in the content you provide.

.Translator configuration (j1_config.yml)
[source, yaml, role="noclip"]
----
translation:
  enabled:                     true
  provider:                    google

  google:
    layout:                    default
    sourcelanguage:            en
    translationlanguages:      [auto]
----

J1 integrates the *free* translation service provided by Google Translate
(GT) and the *professional* translation services of Deepl (DT). If you want
to get a larger number of international audiences, translating your site can
help target your global audience more easily and quickly.

.Google Translator
lightbox::images--translator[ 800, {data-images--translator} ]

GT is fully integrated with the GDPR-compatible Cookie Consent module. If your
visitors do not agree on cookies required to use Google Translate, GT gets
automatically disabled, and all cookies from Google are deleted from the
user's system.

=== Master Header

The most-top position of a web page is important; this postion is presented to
your vistors very first. The Master Header (Attic) give your reader a fist
impression of what is presented on a page.

Attics may contains (dynamic) *Text*, *Images* or *Videos* to support a page
for the content presented.

.Master Header (image-based)
lightbox::images--master-header[ 800, {data-images--master-header} ]

=== Clipboard

The clipboard is a special function of the operating system of desktop or
mobile computers that temporarily stores copied text or other data in memory.
Once something is stored in the clipboard, comments, the user can paste the data to a
new location.

TIP: Click on the *COPY* button (top-right) in the following source code
section.

.Clipboard
[source, js]
----
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// helper functions
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
function styleSheetLoaded(styleSheet) {
  var sheets     = document.styleSheets,
      stylesheet = sheets[(sheets.length - 1)];

  // find CSS file 'styleSheetName' in document
  for(var i in document.styleSheets) {
    if(sheets[i].href && sheets[i].href.indexOf(styleSheet) > -1) {
      return true;;
    }
  }
}
----

J1 integrates the clipboard functionality of your computer system to copy and
paste examples or code elements from a webpage. A clipboard will help your
users a lot to manage the code snippets you’ve provided.

=== Smooth Scroll

Smooth scrolling (SSR) is an enhanced feature of J1 designed to improve
scrolling and positioning on anchor links. If SSR is enabled, an animated
transition is done for scrolling to headlines (anchor links) and gets
exactly positioned.

=== Enhanced Navigation

When it comes to the usability of a website, your visitors' focus is on one
important component: the Navigation System. The Navigation System used by
J1 Theme is a multi-purpose navigation builder based on the _Bootstrap_ V5
Framework.

.Navigation Module (NAV)
lightbox::images--nav-module[ 800, {data-images--nav-module} ]

The NAV module for J1 consists of four configurable sub-modules:

* Navigation Bar
* MainMenu
* Quicklinks
* TopSearch

All features are available by configuration, and no programming is needed.

.Configuration example for main menu entry  (navigator_menu.yml)
[source, yaml, role="noclip"]
----
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Menu MANUALS
  #
  - item:                                 Manuals
    sublevel:

      # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Resources
      #
      - title:                            Resources
        icon:                             bread-slice
        dropdown:
          - title:                        Country Flags
            href:                         /pages/public/manuals/resources/country_flags/
            icon:                         flag
          - title:                        MD Color Palette
            href:                         /pages/public/manuals/resources/color_palette/
            icon:                         format-color-fill
----

=== Lightboxes

A Lightbox is, in general, a helper which displays enlarged, almost
screen-filling versions of images (or videos) while dimming the remainder
of the page. For the J1 Theme, two different lightboxes are available:

* Lightbox V2
* LightGallery

The default tool employed by J1 Theme is Lightbox V2, a Javascript library
written by Lokesh Dhakar.

----

.Lightbox V2
lightbox::lb-example--template-features[ 300, {data-lb-example--template-features}, group ]

For more complex use cases, like thumbnail gallery previews or video support,
LightGallery can be used alternatively.

----
.LightGallery
gallery::jg_old_times[ role="mb-4 wm-800" ]
----

.LightGallery
gallery::jg_old_times[ role="mb-4 wm-800" ]

=== Text and Image Carousels

J1 Carousel is based on OWL Carousel, a clean and neat jQuery slider plugin
for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousel sliders. Carousels
are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.

.Markup to place a Image carousel (Asciidoc)
[source, apib, role="noclip"]
----
.Image carousel
carousel::demo_simple[role="mb-3"]
----

.Image carousel
carousel::demo_simple[role="mb-3"]

In general, J1 Carousel supports many more sources to be displayed as a
slide show: simple text, for example.

.Text carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-3"]

A more eye-minded type of text-based slide show is a parallax text slider.
If you want to emphasize your statements focussing on the meaning, this kind
of slide show may be interesting.

.Parallax text carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-3"]


=== Text and Image Sliders

Master Slider is a premium image and content slider for any purposes, with
super smooth hardware accelerated transitions. MS is a well-known Slider Plugin
for _WordPress_. J1 implements the *free* version MS Lite of version v2.85.13
(Feb 2022).

masterslider::ms_00005[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

masterslider::ms_00006[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

masterslider::ms_00009[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

=== Image and Video Galleries

Image and Video Galleries allow you to lay out groups of images or videos
in very different ways. J1 supports JustifiedGallery is a great jQuery plugin
to create responsive, infinite, and high-quality justified image galleries.
The gallery uses a so-called masonry grid layout. It works by placing
elements in an optimal position based on available horizontal and vertical
space. Sort of like mason fitting stones in a wall.

.Markup to place the Image Gallery (Asciidoc)
[source, apib, role="noclip"]
----
.Image Gallery
gallery::jg_example[role="mb-5"]
----

.Image Gallery

A JustifiedGallery provides not only images. See the next example of a gallery
for HTML5 video content.

----

.Video Gallery (HTML5)
gallery::jg_video_html5[role="mb-5"]

== Extensions

Frameworks like _Bootstrap_ and Asciidoc are enormously flexible and customizable.
Changing or adding components to frameworks requires a lot of experience. That
is not the idea of J1. Customizations for the base frameworks are prepared,
simple to use, and usable out-of-the-box.

Make your site unique.

=== Bootstrap extensions

A set of Advanced Bootstrap Modals (ABM), based on the free package of Material
Design for Bootstrap, is integrated with the template system. _Bootstrap_
modals are used to add dialogues to your web pages for user notifications.

To improve your visitor’s experience on important information that shouldn’t
be missed. ABMs are a great choice to bring the user’s attention. Using the
J1 Theme predefined modal styles, some emotional weight is added to the
information displayed. Ranging from an info level, a simple warning to
critical messages.

Creating a design for responsive HTML tables is challenging. J1 integrates
responsible HTML tables for _Bootstrap_ to be used for Mobile Devices.

.Responsible HTML table (RTable)
[cols="6a,6a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===
|Variable |Description

|`page.content`
|The content of the Page, rendered or un-rendered
depending upon what Liquid is being processed and what `page` is.

|`page.title`
|The title of the Page.

|`page.date`
|The Date assigned to the Post. This can be overridden in a
Post's front matter by specifying a new date/time in the format
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (assuming UTC), or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT`
(to specify a time zone using an offset from UTC. e.g.
`2008-12-14 10:30:00 +0900`).
|===

=== Asciidoctor extensions

J1 Theme implements a bunch of incubating Ruby-based extensions for
Asciidoctor. Using Asciidoctor extensions, it's easy to integrate lightboxes,
galleries, icon fonts, and other complex elements using Asciidoc tags with
your content pages.

=== Banners and Panels

Banners and panels are complex but configurable building blocks, typically used
for home and landing pages. Examples how to use banners and panels can be found
with the included starter web for the homepage.

.Teaser Banner
lightbox::images--teaser-banner[ 600, {data-images--teaser-banner} ]

.Intro Panel
lightbox::images--intro-panel[ 600, {data-images--intro-panel} ]

=== Blog Post Navigation

To make your Blog Articles available to your vistors, J1 offers an easy to use
navigation module for all your posts. The Blog Post Navigator automatically
generates different views to explore articles by Categoy, Date, or all posts
from an Archive View.

.Blog Post Navigator
lightbox::images--blog-post-navigator[ 600, {data-images--blog-post-navigator} ]

=== Featured example content

All pages from the roundtrip section are provided by the starter web
included with the J1 Theme. Many real-world examples for your content
could be taken from these pages and are easy to use with your website.

.Example Content (Icon Fonts)
lightbox::images--example-content[ 600, {data-images--example-content} ]

=== Royalty Free images

All images for a *Starter Web*, for example, from the roundtrip section, are
included with J1 Theme. All images are taken from Unsplash.com as
*Royalty Free* images and can be used without paying any license fees.

== Integrations

The Internet of today has changed a lot. The new digital world is called the cloud.
Services out of the cloud is a fast-growing business. J1 Theme integrates cloud
services to extend the functionality of a web for commenting features or Bootstrap
themes, for example.

=== Bootstrap Themes

The Themes for the template system J1 are based on the free and open-source
CSS front-end framework _Bootstrap_ of version V5. Using _Bootstrap_ base style
only results in a uniform appearance for the content in terms of the overall
layout, text, tables, and form elements across all modern web browsers
available on the market.

Thanks to the people at link:{url-bootswatch--home}[Bootswatch, {browser-window--new}],
a great set of already prepared _Bootstrap_ stylesheets in various designs are
available on their website. There is no need to start from scratch. Re-define
all the _Bootstrap_ variables, and rebuild the framework files to create a new
theme.

.Bootswatch Themes (Minty)
lightbox::images--bootswatch-themes[ 600, {data-images--bootswatch-themes} ]

Many different styles are available. What is already available at
link:{url-bootswatch--home}[Bootswatch, {browser-window--new}] is at least a
good base for your modifications: your unique design. J1 integrates all
available themes from _Bootswatch_ with the navigator module.

=== Comment providers

Comments became an integral part of almost each website on the web. People
want to talk about what they currently read on your web, listen to or see.
And they want it right there, under what they’ve read or seen, not on their
social networks.

J1 Theme supports currently two comment providers: Disqus (DQC) and
Hyvor (HVC). The comment interfaces from the supported providers can be
integrated by pure configuration.

.Comments by Hyvor Talk
lightbox::images--comments-hyvor[ 800, {data-images--comments-hyvor} ]

Enable the provider you want to use and add your access credentials to the
configuration, and you're done. On all posts or pages you want to use for
comments, the comment interface is shown automatically and can be used by
your visitors.

.Comments configuration for Hyvor (j1_config.yml)
[source, yaml, role="noclip"]
----
  comments:
    enabled:                              true
    provider:                             hyvor

    comments_headline:
      en:                                 Leave a comment
      de:                                 Kommentieren

    hyvor:
      site_id:                           'hyvor-site-id'

    disqus:
      site_id:                           '<your-site-short-name>'
----

DQC is fully integrated with the GDPR-compatible Cookie Consent module. If
your visitors do not agree on cookies needed for Diqus, DQC gets
automatically disabled, and all related cookies are deleted from the user's
system.

=== Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook (JN) is an open source web application that allows data
scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations,
and other multimedia resources. JN combines two components:

A web application::
a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine
explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.

Notebook documents::
a representation of all content visible in the web application, including
inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics,
images, and rich media representations of objects.

The Jupyter Notebook *App* is a server-client application that allows editing
and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Notebook App can be
executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed
on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

Notebook *documents* are used for all sorts of data science tasks such as
exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning and transformation,
data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep
learning. Jupyter notebooks are especially useful for *showing the work*
that your data team has done through a combination of code, markdown, links,
and images.

with every webpage of a J1 website using the J1 NBI module.

=== Google Analytics

Google Analytics (GAL) provides access to a massive amount of data related
to how users find and interact with your site. For example, you can see how
many people visited a specific page, how long they remained there, where your
users live, how certain keywords perform, and so forth.

Google Analytics is integrated by pure configuration. Simply enable the
