The Cheatsheet discuss Git commands for daily use. Many Git commands are available
from the command line. Git offers rich features for version control,
collaboration, and project management. You can explore more Git commands
and options in the official Git documentation.

[role="mt-5"]
== Git status colors

In the Git version control system, the output of the git status command can
be displayed with different colors to provide visual cues about the state of
your repository. The colors help you quickly identify modified, added,
deleted, or untracked files, among other things. The specific colors used
can depend on your terminal configuration, but here are the default colors
commonly used by Git:

* Untracked files: Untracked files are displayed in red color by default.
  These are files that Git is not currently tracking.
* Modified files: Modified files are displayed in green color by default.
  These files have been modified but still need to be staged for commit.
* Staged files: Staged files, ready to be committed, are usually displayed
  in a different color from modified files. By default, staged files are
  not assigned a specific color, but they appear in a separate section
  from modified files.
* Renamed or moved files: Renamed or moved files are displayed in green,
  indicating that they have been renamed or moved since the last commit.
* Deleted files: Deleted files are displayed in red, indicating that they
  have been removed from the repository.
* Unmerged files: Unmerged files, resulting from conflicts during a merge
  operation, are typically displayed in a different color, such as yellow or purple.

It's important to note that the actual colors displayed may vary depending
on your terminal configuration and settings. You can customize the colors
used by Git by modifying your terminal's color scheme or configuring
Git-specific color options in your Git configuration file (~/.gitconfig).

== Git Aliases

Git aliases allow you to create shortcuts or alternative names for Git
commands and workflows, making it easier and faster to execute common
operations. You can define aliases in your personal Git configuration file
`~/.gitconfig`, either globally for all repositories or locally for a
specific repository.

[role="mt-5"]
== Branch Commands

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to manage
multiple code branches within a repository. A branch in is used to keep
your *changes* until they are *ready*. You can do your work on a branch
like *develop* while the main branch (main) remains stable (unchanged).
After you are done (on the branch *develop* for example), you can *merge*
the changes it to the main branch for a new stable version.

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-5"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`branch`

----
|===


== Checkout Commands

The `git checkout` command is used to *switch* between *branches*,
create new branches, or restore files to a *previous state*.

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-5"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`checkout <branch-name>`
|Switch to a different branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git checkout main
----

|`checkout -b <branch-name>`
|*Create* a new branch and switch to it.
|
[source, sh]
----
git checkout -b develop
----

|`checkout -b <branch-name> <remote-name>/<branch-name>`

|Checkout a *new* local branch `<branch-name>` based on a *tag*.
|
[source, sh]
----
git checkout -b b2023.2.6 v2023.2.6
----

|===

.Detached HEAD state
[TIP]
====
In Git, the *detached HEAD* state refers to a situation where the
currently checked out commit is *not* associated with a *branch*. Instead
of being on a branch, the HEAD points directly to a specific *commit*.

When you typically work on a branch in Git, the HEAD is associated with that
branch, and any new commits you create will be added to the branch's history.
However, in a detached HEAD state, any new commits you create will not be
part of any branch. The HEAD points directly to the commit.
====

[role="mt-5"]
== Cherry Pick Commands

The `git cherry-pick` command is used to apply *specific commits* from
one branch to another. It lets you pick *individual commits* and apply
them to the *current branch*.

CAUTION: Some commonly used `cherry-pick` commands allow you to apply
commits from one branch to another selectively. It is important to note
that cherry-picking can introduce *conflicts*, especially if the same
changes have been made in *different* branches.

The command takes changes from a target commit and places them on
the HEAD of the currently checked out branch. From here, you can either
continue working with these changes in your working directory or you can
immediately commit the changes onto the new branch.

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-5"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`cherry-pick <commit_hash>`
|Apply a commit’s changes onto a different branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
----

|`cherry-pick <commit_hash1> <commit_hash2>`
|Apply changes from multiple commits to the current branch. The commits are
applied in the order specified.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick <commit_hash1> <commit_hash2>
----

|`cherry-pick -n <commit_hash>`
|Perform a *no commit* cherry-pick, which applies the changes from the
specified commit but does not create a new commit. This allows you to
modify the changes before committing them.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick -n <commit_hash>
----

|`cherry-pick --edit <commit_hash>`
|Opens the commit message editor before committing the cherry-picked
changes. It allows you to modify the commit message.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick --edit <commit_hash>
----

|`cherry-pick --continue`
|Continues the cherry-pick process after resolving any conflicts that
occurred during the cherry-pick operation.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick --continue
----

|`cherry-pick --abort`
|Aborts the cherry-pick operation and returns the branch to its original
state before the cherry-pick was started.
|
[source, sh]
----
git cherry-pick --abort
----

|===

TIP: The cherry pick command can be helpful if you accidentally make a
commit to the *wrong branch*. Cherry picking allows you to get those
changes onto the correct branch without redoing any work. After the
commit it’s been cherry picked, you can either continue working
with the changes before committing, or you can immediately commit
the changes onto the target branch.


[role="mt-5"]
== Clone Commands

The git clone command creates a copy of a Git repository in a new directory.
It retrieves the entire repository, including all its files, branches, and
commit history.

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`clone <repository-url>`
|Clone a specified remote repository.
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url>
----

|`clone <repository-url> <directory-name>`
|Clone a repository and name the local directory.
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url> <directory-name>
----

|`clone <repository-url> --origin <name>`
|Clone a repository and name the remote (`<name>`). If you do not wish
to name the remote, Git will provide the default name `origin`.
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url> --origin <name>
----

|`clone <repository-url> --branch <branch-name>`
|Clone a repository and checkout the specific branch. 
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url> --branch <branch-name>
----

|`clone <repository-url> --depth <depth>`
|Clone a repository with a specified number of commits (`<depth>`). 
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url> --depth <depth>
----

|`clone <repository-url> --no-tags`
|Clone a repository without copying the repo’s tags.
|
[source, sh]
----
git clone <repository-url> --no-tags
----

|===

[role="mb-4"]
Here’s what each part of the command means:

* `<repository_url>`, this is the repository URL you want to clone. It can
  be a *remote* repository URL (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) or a *local path*
  to a repository.
* `<directory_name>` (optional), this is the directory name where the
  repository will be cloned. Git will create a new directory using the
  repository's name if not specified.


[role="mt-5"]
== Commit Commands

The git `commit` command is used to record *changes* to the repository. It
creates a new *commit* that includes the changes you have made to your files.
Commits serve as *snapshots* of the repository at a specific point in time
and form the basis of the Git version control system.

Here's what each part of the command means:

* `-m <commit_message>`, this option allows you to provide a commit message
  describing the commit changes made. The commit message should be concise
  but informative, summarizing the purpose or nature of the changes.

Additionally, you can use various options and flags with the git commit
command to modify its behavior. Some commonly used options include:

  * `-a`, automatically stages all modified files before committing.
  * `-am <commit_message>`, combines the `-a` and `-m` options, allowing
     you to automatically stage modified files and provide a commit message
     in a *single* command.
  * `-p`, interactively selects and commits changes from specific hunks within
     modified files.

To make a commit, you typically follow these steps:

. Make changes to your files in the repository using any text editor or IDE.
. Use the git add command to stage the changes you want to include in the commit.
  The add option tells Git which files should be part of the commit. For
  example, you can use git add `.` (dot) to stage all changes in the current
  directory.
. Once you have staged the changes, use the git commit command to create a
  new commit. Provide a meaningful *commit message* using the `-m` option.

After executing the commit command, Git will create a new commit with your
staged changes. The commit will be assigned a *unique identifier*, a
SHA-1 hash, and added to the repository's commit *history*.

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-5"]

[role="mt-5"]
== Merge Commands

When using Git, several commands are available to perform a merge operation.
The most commonly used commands for merging branches are `git merge` and
`git pull` (see <<Pull Commands>>).

Here's an overview of these commands:

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`merge`
|Combine two or more development histories together. Used in
combination with fetch, this will combine the fetched history
from a remote branch into the currently checked out local branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge
----

|`merge <branch-name>`
|Merge changes from one branch into the branch you currently
have checked out.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge develop
----

|`merge --abort`
|Aborts the merge process and restores  project’s state
to before the merge was attempted. This works as a failsafe when
a conflict occurs.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge --abort develop
----

|`merge --continue`
|Attempt to complete a merge that was stopped due to file conflicts
after *resolving* the merge *conflict*.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge --continue develop
----

|`merge --squash`
|Combine all changes from the branch being merged into a single
commit rather than preserving them as individual commits.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge --squash
----

|`merge --no-commit`
|Combine branch into the current branch, but do not make a new commit.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge --no-commit develop
----

|`merge --no-ff`
|Creates a merge commit instead of attempting a *fast-forward*.
|
[source, sh]
----
git merge --no-ff develop
----

|===

TIP: These are the basic commands for merging branches in Git. Additionally,
you can use some more options and flags with these commands to modify their
behavior. I recommend consulting the Git documentation for a more comprehensive
understanding of the available options and scenarios where merging can be
used effectively.


[role="mt-5"]
== Pull Commands

The `git pull` command *fetches* and *merges* changes from a remote repository
into the *current branch*. Here's an overview of the `pull` command and
its commonly used options:

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`pull`
|This command fetches, and merges changes from the *remote* repository into
your current *local* branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git pull
----

|`pull --quiet`
|Suppress the output text after both `git fetch` and `git merge`.
|
[source, sh]
----
git pull --quiet
----
|`pull --verbose`
|Expand the output text after both `git fetch` and `git merge`.
|
[source, sh]
----
git pull --verbose
----

|===

=== Commands related to a `merge`

When performing a `git pull` command, you typically *fetch and merge* the
latest changes from a remote repository into your current branch. Here
are some common scenarios related to merging during a `pull`:

* `git pull --squash` – Combine all changes from the branch being
  merged into a single commit, rather than preserving the individual
  commits.
* `git pull --no-commit` – Combine the currently checked out
  branch with the remote upstream branch.
* `git pull --no-ff` –  Create a merge commit in all cases, even
  when the merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.

=== Commands related to a `fetch`

When using Git, the `git pull` command *fetches and merges* changes from a
remote repository into your local repository. It combines the `git fetch`
command (to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository) with
the `git merge` command (to incorporate those changes into your local branch).

Here are some `git pull` commands and related options you can use in
different scenarios:

* `git pull --all`  – Fetch all remotes. 
* `git pull --depth=<depth>` – Fetch a limited number of commits. 
* `git pull --dry-run` – Show the action that would be completed
  without actually making changes to your repo.
* `git pull --prune` – Remove all remote references that no longer
  exist on the remote.
* `git pull --no-tags` – Do not fetch tags.


[role="mt-5"]
== Push Commands

The `git push` command *uploads* local repository commits to a *remote*
repository. It is used to share your changes with others or to update
a remote repository with your latest work. Here's an overview of the `push`
command and its commonly used options:

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`push`
|Push the current checked out branch to the *default* remote `origin`. 
|
[source, sh]
----
git push
----

|`push <remote> <branch>`
|Push the specified *local* branch along with all of its necessary commits
to your destination *remote* repository. 
|
[source, sh]
----
git push origin main
----

|`push <remote> --force`
|Force a Git push in a non-fast-forward merge. This option forces
the update of a remote ref even when that is not the ancestor of the
local ref. This can cause the remote repository to loose commits,
so use with care.
|
[source, sh]
----
git push <remote> --force
----

|`push <remote> --all`
|Push *all* local branches to a specified remote.
|
[source, sh]
----
git push <remote> --all
----

|`git push <remote> --tags`
|Push all local tags to a specified remote (can ommitted for *default* remote).
Note that tags are *not* automatically sent when using `--all`.
|
[source, sh]
----
git push origin --tags
----

|===


[role="mt-5"]
== Rebase Commands

The `git rebase` command that integrates changes from one branch onto
another. It allows you to modify the *commit history* of a branch by
moving, combining, or deleting commits.

Here are some commonly used Git rebase commands:

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`rebase <target branch name>`
|Rebase your currently checked out branch onto a target branch.
This rewrites a commit(s) from the source branch and applies it on
the top of the target branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git rebase <target branch name>
----

|`rebase --continue`
|Proceed with a Git rebase after you have resolved a conflict
between files.
|
[source, sh]
----
git rebase --continue
----

|`rebase --skip`
|Skip an action that results in a conflict to proceed with a Git rebase.
|
[source, sh]
----
git rebase --skip
----

|`rebase --abort`
|Cancel a Git rebase. Your branch will be back in the state it was
before you started the rebase.
|
[source, sh]
----
git rebase --abort
----

|`rebase <target branch name> -i`
|Initiate interactive rebase from your currently checked
out branch onto a target branch.
|
[source, sh]
----
git rebase <target branch name> -i
----

|===

CAUTION: The command `rebase` is a flexible way to *manipulate* the commit
*history*. Still, it's important to use it *cautiously*, especially when
working on *shared* branches (like the *main* branch), as it rewrite the
commit history and potentially cause issues for other collaborators.

== Stash Commands

Git stash is a command that *temporarily* saves *changes* you have made to
your working directory so that you can switch to a different branch or
apply the changes *later*.

Here are some commonly used stash commands:

[cols="3a, 4a, 5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3 mb-3"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`stash`
|Create a stash with local modifications and revert back to the head commit.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash
----

|`stash list`
|Display a list of all stashes in your repository.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash list
----

|`stash show`
|View the content of your most recent stash. This will show your
stashed changes as a diff between the stashed content and the commit
from back when the stash was created.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash show
----

|`stash drop <stash>`
|Remove a stash from the list of stashes in your repository.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash drop <stash>
----

|`stash pop <stash>`
|Apply a stash to the top of the current working tree and remove
it from your list of stashes.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash pop <stash>
----

|`stash apply <stash>`
|Apply a stash on top of the current working tree. The stash
will not be removed from your list of stashes.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash apply <stash>
----

|`stash clear`
|Remove all stashes from your repository.
|
[source, sh]
----
git stash clear
----

|===

TIP: Stashing is useful when *switching* branches or *temporarily*
setting aside your changes *without committing* them. It allows you to
work on different tasks or switch contexts without losing your current work.

////
== Make a new commit and create a new message

Make a new commit and create a new message if no changes are made to files

[source, sh]
----
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test on empty commit"
----

== Create a new repository on the command line

[source, sh]
----
echo "# Heroku starter_app" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jekyll-one-org/my_heroku_starter_app.git
git push -u origin main
----

== List branches

git branch -a zeigt alle lokalen und entfernten Branches an, hingegen -r
nur die entfernten Branches anzeigt.

[source, sh]
----
git branch -a
git branch -r
----

== Rename a branch

If you want to rename a local branch while pointed to `any` branch, do:

[source, sh]
----
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
----

If you want to rename the `current` local branch, you can do:

[source, sh]
----
git branch -m <newname>
----

If you want rename a the local branch *and* push|reset the `upstream` branch:

[source, sh]
----
git push origin -u <newname>
git push origin --delete <old_name>
----

== Push current branch to remote (main)

[source, sh]
----
git push --set-upstream origin main
----


== Create branches

Create a branch on your local machine *and* switch in this branch:

[source, sh]
----
git checkout -b <name_of_your_new_branch>
----

NOTE: Git does not allow creating a (new, isolated) branch on a remote
repository. Instead, you can push an existing local branch and thereby
publish it on a remote repository.


== Delete branches

See:
  {https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely}[Stackoverflow]

=== Delete branches from `remote`

[source, sh]
----
git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>
----

NOTE: In most cases the remote name is origin. In such a case you'll
have to use the command like so.

[source, sh]
----
git push -d origin <branch_name>
----

=== Delete branches from `local`

[source, sh]
----
git branch -d <branch_name>
----


== Create branch from commit

Create a branch from a previous `commit`:

[source, sh]
----
git branch branch_name <sha1-of-commit>
----


== Reset repo to a commit

=== Reset from `local`

[source, sh]
----
git reset --hard 217a618
----

=== Reset from `remote`

[source, sh]
----
git push --force origin main
----


== Push an existing repository from the command line

[source, sh]
----
git remote add github https://github.com/jekyll-one-org/heroku_starter_app.git
git push -u github main
----


== Removing non-repository files with git

See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5037480/removing-non-repository-files-with-git

If you want to see which files will be deleted you can use the
option -n *before* you run the actual command:

[source, sh]
----
git clean -n
----

You can use git-clean. This command will remove untracked files/directories.
By default, it will only print what it would have removed, without actually
removing them.

Given the -f flag to remove the files, and the -d flag to remove empty
directories as well:

[source, sh]
----
git clean -df
----

Also removing ignored files:

[source, sh]
----
git clean -dfx
----


== Modify most recent commit message

The git commit option `--amend` allows you to change the *most recent*
commit message:

[source, sh]
----
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
----


== Delete a Git tag

Use the git 'tag' command with the '-d' option

.from local

[source, sh]
----
git tag -d v2023.4.2
----

.from remote

[source, sh]
----
git push -d origin v2023.4.2
----


== Set a Git tag

When modifying remember to issue a new tag command in git before committing,
then push the new tag

[source, sh]
----
git tag -a v2023.4.2 -m "v2023.4.2"
git push origin --tags
----


== Update Git Index (cache) completely

See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274057/how-to-make-git-forget-about-a-file-that-was-tracked-but-is-now-in-gitignore

The series of commands below will remove all of the items from the Git
Index (not from the working directory or local repo), and then updates
the Git Index, while respecting git ignores.

NOTE: Index = Cache

[source, sh]
----
git rm -r --cached . && git add .
----

or forced

[source, sh]
----
git rm -rf --cached . && git add .
----

Then:

[source, sh]
----
git commit -am "Cleanup files"
git commit -am "New version 2023.4.2"
git commit --allow-empty -m "New version 2023.4.2"
git commit -am "Prepare new version 2023.4.2"
git commit -am "Latest files of version 2023.4.2"
----


== Add file permissions on Windows

See: https://medium.com/@akash1233/change-file-permissions-when-working-with-git-repos-on-windows-ea22e34d5cee

Most of the folks on Windows working with git repo’s use windows git bash
for doing git check-ins and check-outs to/from from git repo…. if you are
already not using it i will highly recommend use it… pretty neat tool
for windows os.

[source, sh]

[source, sh]
----
git ls-tree --full-tree -r --name-only HEAD
----


== Disable warning `CRLF will be replaced by LF`

You can turn off the warning with:

[source, sh]
----
git config --global core.safecrlf false
----

NOTE: This will only turn off the warning, not the function itself.


== Upload Gem to Gemfury

[source, sh]
----
  git remote add fury https://jekyll-one@git.fury.io/jekyll-one-org/<package-name>.git
  git push fury master
